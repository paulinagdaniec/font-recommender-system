Roboto has a dual nature. 
It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. 
At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves. 
While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. 
This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.


Updated July 2020: Upgraded to a variable font with Weight and Width axes, that closely match the previous static fonts released as two families, this one and a sibling Roboto Condensed family. 


Roboto is part of a superfamily set that includes Roboto Slab and Roboto Mono

Open Sans is a humanist sans serif typeface designed by Steve Matteson, Type Director of Ascender Corp.
This version contains the complete 897 character set, which includes the standard ISO Latin 1, Latin CE, Greek and Cyrillic character sets.
Open Sans was designed with an upright stress, open forms and a neutral, yet friendly appearance.
It was optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility characteristics in its letterforms.


In March 2021, the family has been updated to a variable font family and it also includes Hebrew, and unified and simplified the licensing under OFL.

The old posters and signs in the traditional Montserrat neighborhood of Buenos Aires inspired Julieta Ulanovsky to design this typeface and rescue the beauty of urban typography that emerged in the first half of the twentieth century. 
As urban development changes that place, it will never return to its original form and loses forever the designs that are so special and unique. 
The letters that inspired this project have work, dedication, care, color, contrast, light and life, day and night! 
These are the types that make the city look so beautiful.
The Montserrat Project began with the idea to rescue what is in Montserrat and set it free under a libre license, the SIL Open Font License.


This is the normal family, and it has two sister families so far, Alternates and Subrayada. 
Many of the letterforms are special in the Alternates family, while 'Subrayada' means 'Underlined' in Spanish and celebrates a special style of underline that is integrated into the letterforms found in the Montserrat neighborhood.


Updated November 2017: The family was redrawn by Jacques Le Bailly at Baron von Fonthausen over the summer, and the full set of weights were adjusted to make the Regular lighter and better for use in longer texts. 
In fall, Julieta Ulanovsky, Sol Matas, and Juan Pablo del Peral, led the development of Cyrillic support, with consultation with Carolina Giovagnoli, Maria Doreuli, and Alexei Vanyashin.

Lato means “Summer” in Polish, and it is a sans serif typeface family started in the summer of 2010 by Warsaw-based designer Łukasz Dziedzic.
Originally conceived as part of a corporate identity for a large client, the family became available for a public release when they decided to go in different stylistic direction. 


Łukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially conflicting priorities in the design; 
to create a typeface that seems “transparent” when used in body text but also displays original traits in larger size use. 
Classical proportions, particularly in the uppercase, give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance, and combine with a sleek treatement that feels contemporary without being trendy. 
Semi-rounded details feel warm, while the underlying structure provides stability and seriousness. 
“Serious but friendly, with the feeling of the Summer,” said Łukasz.

Geometric sans serif typefaces have been a popular design tool ever since these actors took to the world’s stage.
Poppins is one of the new comers to this long tradition. 
With support for the Devanagari and Latin writing systems, it is an internationalist take on the genre.


Many of the Latin glyphs (such as the ampersand) are more constructed and rationalist than is typical. 
The Devanagari design is particularly new, and is the first ever Devanagari typeface with a range of weights in this genre.
Just like the Latin, the Devanagari is based on pure geometry, particularly circles.


Each letterform is nearly monolinear, with optical corrections applied to stroke joints where necessary to maintain an even typographic color. 
The Devanagari base character height and the Latin ascender height are equal; Latin capital letters are shorter than the Devanagari characters, and the Latin x-height is set rather high.


The Devanagari is designed by Ninad Kale.
The Latin is by Jonny Pinhorn.

Roboto Mono is a monospaced addition to the Roboto type family. 
Like the other members of the Roboto family, the fonts are optimized for readability on screens across a wide variety of devices and reading environments. 
While the monospaced version is related to its variable width cousin, it doesn’t hesitate to change forms to better fit the constraints of a monospaced environment. 
For example, narrow glyphs like ‘I’, ‘l’ and ‘i’ have added serifs for more even texture while wider glyphs are adjusted for weight. 
Curved caps like ‘C’ and ‘O’ take on the straighter sides from Roboto Condensed.


Special consideration is given to glyphs important for reading and writing software source code. 
Letters with similar shapes are easy to tell apart. 
Digit ‘1’, lowercase ‘l’ and capital ‘I’ are easily differentiated as are zero and the letter ‘O’. 
Punctuation important for code has also been considered. 
For example, the curly braces ‘{ }’ have exaggerated points to clearly differentiate them from parenthesis ‘( )’ and braces ‘[ ]’. 
Periods and commas are also exaggerated to identify them more quickly. 
The scale and weight of symbols commonly used as operators have also been optimized.

Oswald is a reworking of the classic style historically represented by the 'Alternate Gothic' sans serif typefaces.
The characters of Oswald were initially re-drawn and reformed to better fit the pixel grid of standard digital screens.
Oswald is designed to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.


Since the initial launch in 2011, Oswald was updated continually by Vernon Adams until 2014.
Vernon added Light and Bold weights, support for more Latin and Cyrillic languages, tightened the spacing and kerning and made many glyph refinements throughout the family based on hundreds of users' feedback.
In 2016 the Latin part of the family was updated by Kalapi Gajjar to complete the work started by Vernon.
In January 2019, it was updated with a variable font Weight axis.

Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface family. 
Initially designed by Matt McInerney as a single thin weight, it was expanded into a 9 weight family by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida in 2012 and iKerned by Igino Marini.
A thorough review and italic was added in 2016.


It is a display face and the download features both old style and lining numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete set of diacritics, as well as a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric sans-serif typefaces than its neo-grotesque inspired default character set.


It also has a sister family, Raleway Dots.

Playfair is a transitional design. 
In the European Enlightenment in the late 18th century, broad nib quills were replaced by pointed steel pens as the popular writing tool of the day.
Together with developments in printing technology, ink, and paper making, it became to print letterforms of high contrast and delicate hairlines that were increasingly detached from the written letterforms.


This design lends itself to this period, and while it is not a revival of any particular design, it takes influence from the designs of John Baskerville and from ‘Scotch Roman’ designs.
Being a Display (large size) design in the transitional genre, functionally and stylistically it can accompany Georgia for body text.


This is the main family, with a sibling Playfair Display SC small caps family. 
The main family downloaded font files include a full set of small caps, common ligatures, and discretionary ligatures.


Updated November 2017 with many small improvements and additional language support. The family has been converted to a variable font in August 2019.


The Playfair project is led by Claus Eggers Sørensen, a type designer based in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

Mukta is a Unicode compliant, versatile, contemporary, humanist, mono-linear typeface family available in seven weights, supporting Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurumukhi, Tamil and Latin scripts.
This type family is a libre licensed version of Ek's self-titled multi-script project, an ongoing effort to develop a unified type family for each Indian script.
The goal is to build one harmonious family across all Indian scripts without letting the visual features of one script dominate over others.
This ensures that the fonts can be used successfully for both single and multi-script purposes.


Mukta was designed by Girish Dalvi and Yashodeep Gholap.
Mukta Vaani was designed by Noopur Datye and Pallavi Karambelkar with support from Sarang Kulkarni and Maithili Shingre.
Mukta Malar was designed by Aadarsh Rajan.
Mukta Mahee was designed by Shuchita Grover and Noopur Datye.


Ek would like to thank Vinay Saynekar, Santosh Kshirsagar, Shubhanand Jog, Yogesh Jahargirdar, Pradnya Naik, Snehal Patil, Omkar Shende and Dave Crossland for their suggestions and feedback during the font design process.
Ek would also like to thank faculty and friends from the Industrial Design Centre, IIT Bombay, and from Sir J J Institute of Applied Art, for their support and encouragement.

Kanit means mathematics in Thai, and the Kanit typeface family is a formal Loopless Thai and Sans Latin design.
It is a combination of concepts, mixing a Humanist Sans Serif motif with the curves of Capsulated Geometric styles that makes it suitable for various uses, contemporary and futuristic.
A notable detail is that the stroke terminals have flat angles, which allows the design to enjoy decreased spacing between letters while preserving readability and legibility at smaller point sizes.


In Thai typeface design the formal loopless Thai typefaces have more simple forms than the conservative looped Thai designs, and this simplification has to be done properly in order to preserve the essential character of each letter. 
Sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall textures.
When designing Kanit, special care was taken with some groups of letters such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, and ข ช to ensure they are distinct and legible, because it might lead to confusion if each glyph is not clear enough.


Kanit is the first Thai font family to be hinted with TTFAutohint, an easy-to-use hinting tool that is highly recommended.


The Kanit project is led by Cadson Demak, a type foundry in Thailand.

Work Sans is a typeface family based loosely on early Grotesques, such as those by Stephenson Blake, Miller & Richard and Bauerschen Giesserei. 
The Regular weight and others in the middle of the family are optimised for on-screen text usage at medium-sizes (14px-48px) and can also be used in print design.
The fonts closer to the extreme weights are designed more for display use both on the web and in print.
Overall, features are simplified and optimised for screen resolutions; for example, diacritic marks are larger than how they would be in print.
A version optimised for desktop applications is available from the Work Sans github project page.


The Work Sans project is led by Wei Huang, a type designer from Australia.

Updated August 2015: All styles were updated to v1.40 to change the Thin (100) style to be the same as 'HairLine' in previous versions - even thinner! 
This avoids the complication of a second ""Hairline"" family. 
The ExtraLight (200) and Light (300) styles also changed accordingly.
Reflow will occur from previous versions on these weights.


Updated February 2020: Family has been upgraded to a variable font family.

It was initially drawn in 2011 by Vernon Adams and then refined until 2014, adding more weights, support for more Latin languages, tightened the spacing and kerning and made many glyph refinements throughout the family – all based on hundreds of users' feedback.
In 2017 the family was updated by Jacques Le Bailly to complete the work started by Vernon after he passed away, in collaboration with his wife Allison, an arist who holds the trademark on the typeface family name.
In August 2019, it was updated with a Variable Font ""Weight"" axis.

Inconsolata was Raph Levien's first serious original font release. 
It is a monospace font, designed for printed code listings and the like. 
There are a great many “programmer fonts,” designed primarily for use on the screen, but in most cases do not have the attention to detail for high resolution rendering.


Inconsolata draws from many inspirations and sources. 
I was particularly struck by the beauty of Luc(as) de Groot's Consolas, which is his monospaced design for Microsoft's Vista release. 
This font, similar to his earlier TheSansMono, demonstrated clearly to me that monospaced fonts do not have to suck.


The development of the Regular style by Raph Levien was started in 2006 using his own Spiro-based tools and FontForge.
The Bold style was designed by Kirill Tkachev and the Cyreal foundry in 2012.

    IBM Plex® is the corporate typeface for IBM worldwide and an open-source project developed by the IBM Brand &
    Experience team (BX&D). Plex is an international typeface family designed to capture IBM’s brand spirit
    and history and to illustrate the unique relationship between mankind and machine—a principal theme for IBM since
    the turn of the century. The result is a neutral yet friendly Grotesque style typeface that balances design with the
    engineered details that make Plex distinctly IBM. The
    family includes a Sans, Sans Condensed, Mono, and Serif and has excellent legibility in print, web, and mobile
    interfaces.


    Plex’s three designs work well independently and even better together. Use the Sans as a
    contemporary compadre, the Serif for editorial storytelling, or the Mono to show code snippets. The unexpectedly
    expressive nature of the italics gives you even more options for your designs. Currently, IBM Plex Sans supports
    Extended Latin, Arabic, Cyrillic, Devanagari, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean and Thai.

Hind Siliguri is a family of five Bengali fonts, which are part of the Indian Type Foundry’s larger Open Source Hind Multi-Script project. 
Hind Multi-Script is a type system providing nine stylistically-matching font families – one for each of the following writing systems used in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka: Bengali, Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, and Sinhala. 
In addition to Bengali, the Hind Siliguri fonts also include Latin-script characters.


Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. 
Most of these strokes have flat endings: they either terminate with a horizontal or a vertical shear, rather than on a diagonal. 
This helps create clear-cut counter forms between the characters. 
Additionally, Hind’s letterforms feature open apertures. 
The entire family feels very legible when used to set text.


The Bengali and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that the Bengali headline is more or less at the same visual height as the Latin capital letters share. 
The exact height of the Bengali headline increases vis à vis the capital height as the family increases in weight, just as the Latin lowercase does. 
Each font in the Hind Siliguri family has 820 glyphs, including many unique Bengali conjuncts. 
These ensure support for the languages written with the Bengali script. 
The Latin component’s character set is Adobe Latin 3, which enables typesetting in English and the other Western European languages.


Hind Siliguri is a solid alternate when choosing typefaces for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding. 
Jyotish Sonowal designed Hind Siliguri for ITF, who first published the fonts in 2015. 
Hind Siliguri is named after Siliguri, a city in West Bengal, India.

The Hind Siliguri project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type design foundry based in Ahmedabad, India.

What happens on screen ends up being more important than what comes out of the printer. With the accelerating popularity of electronic books, type designers are working hard to seek out the ideal designs for reading on screen.
Motivated by her love for the pixel, Sol Matas designed Bitter. A ""contemporary"" slab serif typeface for text, it is specially designed for comfortably reading on any computer or device. The robust design started from the austerity of the pixel grid, based on rational rather than emotional principles. It combines the large x-heights and legibility of the humanistic tradition with subtle characteristics in the characters that inject a certain rhythm to flowing texts.
Bitter has little variation in stroke weight and the Regular style is thicker than a usual ‘Regular’ style for print design. This generates an intense color in paragraphs, accentuated by the serifs that are as thick as strokes with square terminals.
Each glyph is carefully designed with an excellent curve quality added to the first stage of the design, that was entirely made in a pixel grid. The typeface is balanced and manually spaced to use very few kerning pairs.

The close companionship of Serif and Sans is achieved by a careful match of letter proportions and typographic color. Source Serif is loosely based on the work of Pierre Simon Fournier, and many idiosyncrasies typical to Fournier’s designs (like the bottom serif on the b or the middle serif on the w) are also found in Source Serif. Without being a pure historical revival, Source Serif takes cues from Fournier and reworks them for a modern age.
Both typeface families have different personalities because they spring from the hands of different designers: Source Serif was designed by Frank Grießhammer, Source Sans was designed by Paul Hunt. Robert Slimbach consulted on both designs, which helped maintain the overall family harmony. Either design feels confident on its own but also works in combination with the other — just like their designers do.
Source Serif continues Adobe’s line of high-quality open source typefaces. Designed for a digital environment, the letter shapes are simplified and highly readable. Its historical roots, combined with expert guidance give the typeface a strong character of its own that will shine when used for extended text on paper or screen.
Source Serif is an active Open Source project – if you are interested in contributing, please visit source-serif-pro on Github for more information.

Cabin is a humanist sans inspired by Edward Johnston's and Eric Gill's typefaces, with a touch of modernism.
Cabin incorporates modern proportions, optical adjustments, and some elements of the geometric sans.
It remains true to its roots, but has its own personality.


The Cabin font family comes in two variable fonts, roman and true italic, with a Weight range from Regular to Bold, and a Width range from normal to Condensed.
The stroke contrast is almost monolinear, although top and bottom curves are slightly thinned.
Counters of the b, g, p and q are rounded, and all are optically adjusted.

As an open source project, it is expected that incremental updates will be made over time to extend glyph set coverage and functionality. In 2019, we have updated the family to Roman v2.030 and Italic v1.050. This update now supports Greek, Cyrillic, Vietnamese and Italic styles.

EB Garamond is intended to be an excellent, classical, Garamond.
It is a community project to create a revival of Claude Garamont’s famous humanist typefaces from the mid-16th century.
This digital version reproduces the original design by Claude Garamont closely: 
The source for the letterforms is a scan of a specimen known as the “Berner specimen,” which was composed in 1592 by Conrad Berner, the son-in-law of Christian Egenolff and his successor at the Egenolff print office.
This specimen shows Garamont’s roman and Granjon’s italic types at different sizes.
Hence the name of this project: Egenolff-Berner Garamond.


Why another Garamond?
That typeface is a key moment in the history of typography, and European type designers have been reacting to this work ever since.
It is probably the most revived typeface in the world and many are excellent.
In the world of free/libre culture, however, only a few Garamond-inspired types exist, and none share the scope of this project.


In November 2019, the family has been updated to a variable font family.

The simple and geometric Latin was developed to work harmoniously with the loopless Thai that has wide proportions and airy negative space. 
It is suitable for both web and print usage, such as magazines, newspapers, and posters. 


A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, ข ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. 
Formal loopless Thai typefaces are simplified, compared to traditional looped Thai types, and this simplification has to be done properly in order to preserve the essense of each character. 
The size and position of Thai vowel and tone marks has been managed carefully, because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.

The new OpenType format gives us the possibility to have multiple versions of each letter, and that's exactly what we are doing: Instead of compromising the design of our letters to force connections, we do what lettering artist do.

Hind is an Open Source typeface supporting the Devanagari and Latin scripts. 
Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, the Hind font family includes five styles. 
Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, which is paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. 
Most of these strokes have flat endings: they either terminate with a horizontal or a vertical shear, rather than on a diagonal. 
This helps create clear-cut counter forms between the characters. 
In addition to this, Hind’s letterforms feature open apertures. 
The entire typeface family feels very legible when used to set text.


The Devanagari and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that the Devanagari headline falls just below the Latin capital-height. 
In other words, the Devanagari base characters are 94% as tall as the Latin uppercase. 
Text set in the Devanagari script sits nicely alongside the Latin lowercase, too. 
Hind’s Devanagari vowel marks take forms that tends toward the traditional end of the design spectrum, while the knotted terminals inside of the base characters feature a treatment that appears more contemporary.


Each font in the Hind family has 1146 glyphs, which include hundreds of unique Devanagari conjuncts. 
These ensure full support for the major languages written with the Devanagari script. 
The Latin component’s character set is a basic western one, which enables typesetting in English and the other Western European languages. 
Hind is a solid choice for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding.

Aloha!
Pacifico is an original and fun brush script handwriting font by Vernon Adams which was inspired by the 1950s American surf culture in 2011.
It was redrawn by Jacques Le Bailly at Baron von Fonthausen in 2016.
It was expanded to Cyrillic by Botjo Nikoltchev and Ani Petrova at Lettersoup in 2017.


The Pacifico project was commissioned by Google from Vernon Adams, an English type designer who lived in San Clemente, Los Angeles, USA.
To contribute, see github.com/googlefonts/Pacifico


Updated June 2019 to v3.000: Added extended Cyrillic support.

Rajdhani has modularized letterforms and supports the Devanagari and Latin writing systems. 
The squared and condensed appearance may be interpreted as technical or even futuristic. 
Typically round bowls and other letterform elements have straight sides in Rajdhani. 
The stroke terminals typically end in flat line segments that are horizontal or vertical, rather than diagonal. 
Their corners are slightly rounded, giving stroke-endings a softer feeling, rather than a pointy one.


Satya Rajpurohit and Jyotish Sonowal developed the Devanagari component together, while the Latin was designed by Shiva Nalleperumal.

Space Grotesk is a proportional sans-serif typeface variant based on Colophon Foundry's fixed-width Space Mono family (2016). Originally designed by Florian Karsten in 2018, Space Grotesk retains the monospace's idiosyncratic details while optimizing for improved readability at non-display sizes.

Arvo is a geometric slab-serif typeface family suited for screen and print. 
The family includes 4 cuts: Roman, Italic, Roman Bold, Bold Italic. 
It is a libre font, first published in Google Fonts. 
The flavour of the font is rather mixed. 
It's monolinear-ish, but has a tiny bit of contrast (which increases the legibility a little in Mac OS X.)


The name Arvo is a typical Estonian man's name, but is not widely used today. 
In the Finnish language, Arvo means ""number, value, worth."" Considering how much programming is involved in hinting, all these meanings are true.


In December 2013 Arvo 2.0.1 was released, with support for languages that use the Cyrillic script, the latin script is expanded to Adobe's  Glyph List 3, and many truetype hints are improved especially for in smaller sizes (regular cuts start now from 9ppem). 
Also added PANOSE classification numbers, cleaned up character palette order, and many more smaller bug fixes were made.


Updated August 2015: Bold and Bold Italic styles were updated to allow document embedding.

Cormorant was conceived, drawn, spaced, kerned, programmed, interpolated, and produced in its entirety by Christian Thalmann of Catharsis Fonts.

While this project was heavily inspired by Claude Garamont's immortal legacy, Christian did not use any specific font as a starting point or direct reference for the designs. Most glyphs were drawn from scratch; when he needed guidance on a specific character, he searched for the term Garamond and skimmed through the results for a general impression.
He is grateful to the creative souls on the Typophile, TypeDrawers and Typografie forums, and Github, for a wealth of knowledge about type design, and for providing a large amount of excellent feedback on Cormorant during its development. He also thanks the tireless folks at Glyphs, in particular Rainer Erich Scheichelbauer of Schriftlabor and Georg Seifert.

Hind Madurai is a family of five Tamil fonts, which are part of the Indian Type Foundry’s larger Open Source Hind Multi-Script project. 
In addition to Tamil, the Hind Madurai fonts also include Latin-script characters.


Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. 
Most of these strokes have flat endings: they either terminate with a horizontal or a vertical shear, rather than on a diagonal. 
This helps create clear-cut counter forms between the characters. 
Additionally, Hind’s letterforms feature open apertures and counterforms. 
The entire family feels very legible when used to set text.


The Tamil and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that the head of the Tamil characters falls just below the Latin capital-height. 
Depending in the font weight, Tamil letters appear to be about 80–85% of the height of the Latin uppercase. 
Text set in the Tamil script sits nicely alongside the Latin’s lowercase, too. 
Although Hind Madurai is a “monolinear sans” face, much of its design features tends toward the traditional end of the design spectrum.
Each font in the Hind Madurai family has 552 glyphs, which includes all of the characters needed to write Tamil. 
The Latin character set is Adobe Latin 3, enabling typesetting for English and other Western European languages. 


Hind Madurai is a solid alternate when choosing typefaces for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding. 
Jyotish Sonowal designed Hind Madurai for ITF, who first published the fonts in 2015. 
Hind Madurai is named after Madurai, a city in Tamil Nadu, India.


The Hind Madurai project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type design foundry based in Ahmedabad, India.

Red Hat is a fresh take on the geometric sans genre, taking inspiration from a range of American sans serifs including Tempo and Highway Gothic. The Display styles are low contrast and spaced tightly, with a large x-height and open counters. The Text styles have a slightly smaller x-height and narrower width for better legibility, are spaced more generously, and have thinned joins for better performance at small sizes. The two families can be used together seamlessly at a range of sizes.
The family has been upgraded to variable fonts with a weight axis (Light to Bold) in June 2021.

Secular One is an original Hebrew and Latin humanistic sans serif typeface with a single weight.
At the time of publication (2016) there were not yet many Hebrew sans serif text typefaces.

The Secular letterforms work equally well when used at large sizes where the delicate and eccentric elements are revealed, making it useful for branding purposes as well as typsetting long-form texts.

familiar typefaces that have been in use from more than 100 years like
Clarendon, Century, Cheltenham and Clearface.

The rounded letters (b, c, d, e, o, p, q) are a bit squarish on the inside. This feature opens up the counters for better rendering and also make it look a bit more up-to-date than the classic typefaces previously referenced.
The serifs are a bit shorter than usual. Another feature that improves the rendering by allowing more ""air"" between each letter pair.
The joins of the stems to the branches in letters like h, m, n are deep enough to prevent dark spots, also improving legibility at small sizes.
The friendly lowercase 'a', with the curve starting from the bottom of the stem, is reminiscent of Cheltenham and Clearface. That soft curve is also echoed in the curves of the f, j, n, m and r.
The spacing is also optimized for body text on the web, clearly more open than that of typefaces made for print or for headlines.

If you’ve ever seen a futuristic sci-fi movie, you may have noticed that all other fonts have been lost or destroyed in the apocalypse that led humans to flee earth. Only those very few geometric typefaces have survived to be used on spaceship exteriors, spacestation signage, monopolistic corporate branding, uniforms featuring aerodynamic shoulder pads, etc. Of course Orbitron could also be used on the posters for the movies portraying this inevitable future.

It has a large x-height, ample proportions, big serifs and large apertures that allow the letters to be clear, even at small sizes on low resolution screens. The capitals are unusually small, allowing them to be used as substitutes for small caps. (It's recommended to add some tracking if used in this way.) One major feature is the break in the internal curves of round characters. While this break makes some interesting forms at large sizes, their true purpose is to help make the counterforms more open at small sizes by allowing straighter stems. This reasoning is famously known as W.A. Dwiggins' “M-formula.” The italics were designed to contrast with the roman styles while maintaining good legibility. The true italic forms also have big counterforms and simple curves. The fonts have been manually hinted to get the best possible rasterization in Windows. The Noticia font family project is envisioned as 18 different fonts styles, with text, condensed, display and sans variants, different weights and including italic versions, all designed and hinted to work well on computer and mobile devices screens.

Kalam is a handwriting-style typeface supporting the Devanagari and Latin scripts.
This is an Open Source font family first published by the Indian Type Foundry in 2014.


Even though Kalam's letterforms derive from handwriting, the fonts have each been optimised for text on screen.
All in all, the typeface is a design that feels very personal.
Like many informal handwriting-style fonts, it appears rather fresh and new when seen on screen or printed on the page.
Kalam's letterforms feature a very steep slant from the top right to the bottom left.
They are similar to letters used in everyday handwriting, and look like they might have been written with either a thin felt-tip pen, or a ball-point pen.
In the Devanagari letterforms, the knotted-terminals are open, but some other counter forms are closed.
Features like these strengthen the feeling that text set in this typeface has been written very quickly, in a rapid manner.


Kalam is available in three weights: Light, Regular and Bold.
Each font contains 1,025 glyphs, which includes many unique Devanagari conjuncts.
These ensure full support for the major languages written with the Devanagari script.
The Latin component's character set is a basic western one, which enables typesetting in English and the other Western European languages.
Lipi Raval and Jonny Pinhorn developed the family for ITF; Raval designed the Devanagari component while she and Pinhorn worked together on the Latin.

Frank Ruhl Libre is an open source version of the classic Hebrew typeface Frank Rühl, the most ubiquitous Hebrew typeface in print.
Frank Rühl was designed in 1908 by Rafael Frank in collaboration with Auto Rühl of the C. F. Rühl foundry of Leipzig. 
A final version was released in 1910. 
Many Israeli books, newspapers and magazines use Frank Rühl as their main body text typeface.


Made to accommodate the growing need for typefaces in secular Hebrew writings, the typeface was fitted to modern printing demands and designed to be readable in longform text, with and without vowel marks.
Frank Rühl has Sephardi proportions (mem-height is approximately 4½ stroke widths), and is based roughly on Venetian typefaces used by printer Daniel Bomberg. 
Frank wrote of his design that he wishes to combine the simpleness of Antiqua with the ""pleasantness"" of Fraktur, leading him to ""quieten"" the letterforms by reducing the contrast between its thin and thick strokes.

This newly designed revival by Yanek Iontef is a family of 7 weights, Light to Black (the original typeface had only one) and in November 2022, it became variable and offers a larger choice of weights.

    Developed for editorial use in headline and display typography, the letterforms infuse a geometric foundation and grotesque details with qualities often found in headline typefaces of the 1960s (See: Microgramma,
    Eurostile), many of which have since been co-opted by science fiction films, television, and literature.


    Typographic features include old-style figures, superscript and subscript numerals, fractions, center-height and cap-height currency symbols, directional arrows, and multiple stylistic alternates.

Alegreya is a typeface originally intended for literature. Among its crowning characteristics, it conveys a dynamic and varied rhythm which facilitates the reading of long texts. Also, it provides freshness to the page while referring to the calligraphic letter, not as a literal interpretation, but rather in a contemporary typographic language.
The italic has just as much care and attention to detail in the design as the roman. The bold weights are strong, and the Black weights are really experimental for the genre. There is also a  Small Caps sibling family.

The old posters and signs in the traditional Montserrat neighborhood of Buenos Aires inspired Julieta to design this typeface and rescue the beauty of urban typography that emerged in the first half of the twentieth century. 
As urban development changes that place, it will never return to its original form and loses forever the designs that are so special and unique. 
The letters that inspired this project have work, dedication, care, color, contrast, light and life, day and night! 
These are the types that make the city look so beautiful.
The Montserrat Project began with the idea to rescue what is in Montserrat and set it free under a libre license, the SIL Open Font License.


This is the Alternates family, a sister to the normal and Subrayada families. 
Many of the letterforms are special in the Alternates family, while 'Subrayada' means 'Underlined' in Spanish and celebrates a special style of underline that is integrated into the letterforms found in the Montserrat neighborhood.


Updated November 2017: The family was redrawn by Jacques Le Bailly at Baron von Fonthausen over the summer, and the full set of weights were adjusted to make the Regular lighter and better for use in longer texts. 
In fall, Julieta Ulanovsky, Sol Matas, and Juan Pablo del Peral, led the development of Cyrillic support, with consultation with Carolina Giovagnoli, Maria Doreuli, and Alexei Vanyashin.

Rokkitt was initiated by Vernon Adams when he was inspired by the type forms of a number of distinctive geometric slab serifs, sometimes called Egyptians, popular in the late nineteenth and early to mid twentieth centuries.
In 1910 the Inland Type Foundry published Litho Antique and similar types were published by American Type Founders in the 1920s and Monotype Corporation in the 1930s.
Rokkitt is intended for use as a display font, in headings and headlines, though it can also be used as an alternative to sans serif designs at text sizes.


Update January 2017:
Vernon Adams began the project in 2011, and developed the typeface until 2014. 
During 2016 Kalapi Gajjar completed Vernon's original work and released a substantial update with a full set of 9 weights, and support for more Latin languages. 


Update July 2019:
The family has been converted into a variable font.


Update January 2023:
The family has now an italic.

    Lexend fonts are intended to reduce visual stress and so improve reading performance. Initially they were designed with dyslexia and struggling readers in mind, but Bonnie Shaver-Troup, creator of the Lexend project, soon found out that these fonts are
    also great for everyone else.


    The first set of Lexend fonts by Thomas Jockin (
    Deca,
    Exa,
    Giga,
    Mega,
    Peta,
    Tera,
    Zetta) becomes wider and more openly spaced (also known as ""tracked out""). This new version of Lexend is a variable font with a weight axis.


    Please note that the initial release of this font had a lighter Regular weight. It has been decided for the update of July 2021 to align the Regular weight with the one of Lexend Deca which is slightly bolder. Lexend and Lexend Deca are therefore the
    same (for now…). Ultimately this version will offer a HyperExpansion axis which will allow variation of inner and outer space of letterforms.

    True to Bonnie’s vision, Lexend fonts are freely available for all since 2019 in Google Fonts.

Cormorant was conceived, drawn, spaced, kerned, programmed, interpolated, and produced in its entirety by Christian Thalmann of Catharsis Fonts. For an illustrated presentation and description of the family, please visit its Bēhance page.
While this project was heavily inspired by Claude Garamont's immortal legacy, Christian did not use any specific font as a starting point or direct reference for the designs. Most glyphs were drawn from scratch; when he needed guidance on a specific character, he searched for the term Garamond and skimmed through the results for a general impression.
He is grateful to the creative souls on the Typophile, TypeDrawers and Typografie forums, and Github, for a wealth of knowledge about type design, and for providing a large amount of excellent feedback on Cormorant during its development. He also thanks the tireless folks at Glyphs, in particular Rainer Erich Scheichelbauer of Schriftlabor and Georg Seifert. Special thanks go to Dave Crossland and Google Fonts for making the libre release of this font family possible through generous funding of the development process.

Khand is a family of compact mono-linear fonts with very open counter forms. Developed for display typography, the family is primarily intended for headline usage. 
Its letterforms are dynamic, and everything is designed according to a modular system. 
All of its shapes bear a strong commonality to one another, but the typeface strikes a good balancing act and avoids too much repetitiveness. 
The lighter styles are suitable for short paragraphs of running text, while the heavier styles have been optimized for headlines or single word settings.


The base character height in the Khand fonts is ‘big on the body.’ 
Across a line of text, the consonantal forms take up the majority of vertical space. 
Vowel marks above and below have been shortened – keeping these to a minimum allows for lines of text to be set more closely together vertically. 
The reduction of interlinear space is paramount for successful headline typesetting, and Khand performs much better in display applications than similar fonts with more elongated vowel marks. 
Because of their reduced height, the typeface’s vowel mark forms have been simplified somewhat out of necessity, but this stylistic reduction is in-keeping with the modular feeling of the typeface’s overall design. 
Dot-shaped marks appear rounded in order to help maintain their differentiation from other marks.


Khand’s Devanagari component was designed by Sanchit Sawaria and Jyotish Sonowal. 
The Latin component was designed by Satya Rajpurohit.

    Taking inspiration in Neuzeit Grotesk, Futura, and 1930s grotesque sans serifs with almost monolinear
    contrast and pointy curves, the fonts consist of modern and clean cut forms, the x-height dimension slightly taller
    to provide clear spaces between caps and x-height, and also equipped with open counters and balanced spaces to

    some glyphs it has its own diversity and characteristic of various explorations of forms that enrich the expressions
    and stories that coexist. The charms of Plus Jakarta Sans fonts appear when one looks closer, manifesting in a
    beauty that emerges once seen as a whole. Each alternate in the family contains several alternative characters,
    divided into three stylistic sets which Lancip (Sharp), Lurus (Straight), and Lingkar (Swirl).

El Messiri is a modern Arabic typeface family designed by Mohamed Gaber (Arabic) that began with Jovanny Lemonad's Latin and Cyrillic typeface Philosopher. 
The Arabic started with the concept of a curvy Arabic typeface inspired by the beauty of Naskh and drawn as if with a brush instead of the traditional bamboo pen. 
The idea took form with wide counters that improve readability at smaller text sizes, and has subtle details that make it a great display face at larger sizes. 
El Messiri current comes in 4 weights (Light, Regular, SemiBold and Bold) and the Arabic component has a wide glyph set that supports the Arabic, Farsi and Urdu languages.


The font has been upgraded to a variable font with a weight axis (Regular to Bold) in August 2021.

The family consists of three “voices”. The default style is a grotesque with straight stems. As the flair axis grows the straight grotesque terminals develop a swelling and become almost glyphic serifs and the joints become more idiosyncratic. The volume axis transforms the glyphic serifs to wedge-like ones.

Each voice of Commissioner comes in a range of styles from Thin to Black including italics. The diverse proportions of lowercase and capitals add warmth and appeal to texts across sizes, while the different voices can express a variation in the typographic texture that ranges from delicate in text sizes to exuberant in larger sizes.

Padauk is a fully capable Unicode 6 font supporting all the Myanmar characters in the standard.
Thus it provides support for minority languages as well, in both local and Burmese rendering styles.


Downloads of Padauk include the necessary Graphite smarts to render the Myanmar script correctly.
Thus if you want to use this font at full fidelity to the orthography, you will need to use Graphite-capable applications, such as the latest versions of LibreOffice.
However the web font files served by Google Fonts do not include Graphite tables. 
Fortunately, Padauk also has OpenType tables which allow it to be rendered in a basic way, in applications that support OpenType shaping such as Word. 
The web font files served by Google Fonts include the OpenType tables, so the font will work in most web browsers. 

The last upgrade in July 2022, offers an major language support update.

Mukta is a Unicode compliant, versatile, contemporary, humanist, mono-linear typeface family available in seven weights, supporting Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurumukhi, Tamil and Latin scripts.
This type family is a libre licensed version of Ek's self-titled multi-script project, an ongoing effort to develop a unified type family for each Indian script.
The goal is to build one harmonious family across all Indian scripts without letting the visual features of one script dominate over others.
This ensures that the fonts can be used successfully for both single and multi-script purposes.


Mukta was designed by Girish Dalvi and Yashodeep Gholap.
Mukta Vaani was designed by Noopur Datye and Pallavi Karambelkar with support from Sarang Kulkarni and Maithili Shingre.
Mukta Malar was designed by Aadarsh Rajan.
Mukta Mahee was designed by Shuchita Grover and Noopur Datye.


Ek would like to thank Vinay Saynekar, Santosh Kshirsagar, Shubhanand Jog, Yogesh Jahargirdar, Pradnya Naik, Snehal Patil, Omkar Shende and Dave Crossland for their suggestions and feedback during the font design process.
Ek would also like to thank faculty and friends from the Industrial Design Centre, IIT Bombay, and from Sir J J Institute of Applied Art, for their support and encouragement.

Mitr is a Thai word that means “friend” in Thai. 
Mitr is a sans serif Latin and loopless Thai typeface that combines senses of organic and humanist sans serif designs with rounded terminals. 
It has a wide structure and airy negative space that preserves legibility and readability. 
Mitr is a novel and friendly typeface that is suitable for casual usage such as celebration cards, magazines, and posters.


A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, or ข ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. 
Mitr has a specific approach to the thick and thin strokes of Thai glyphs. 
Other type designers may consider this font as an example when developing new fonts. 
Informal looped Thai typefaces have slightly simplified details, as compared to formal ones, and this allows type designers to extend them to heavier weights. 
The size and position of Thai vowel and tone marks have been managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.

    Roboto Flex upgrades Roboto so it becomes a more powerful typeface system. With Flex, you can customize Roboto to express and finesse your text in ways never before possible. Today, people are constantly switching between devices, resizing browsers, and
    spreading our viewports across multiple screens. So Google commissioned Font Bureau to re-imagine Roboto to “flex” along with us, with a special emphasis on large-screen capabilities. This was achieved by amplifying the original design to an extreme
    range of weights, grades, widths and optical sizes.


    The second benefit of Roboto Flex is the designer’s ability to fitness and fine-tune their designs with parametric axes. Font Bureau first demonstrated the concept of parametric
    axes in Amstelvar Alpha (2017), to provide the ultimate in typographic flexibility. With early prototypes of Roboto Flex, Font Bureau demonstrated new solutions to the typographic problems
    that digital designers face. Demonstrations of high quality justification, better dark-mode typography and other uses of parametric axes are documented at variablefonts.typenetwork.com


    The needs of developers, designers, and — of course — end-user readers were prioritized and aligned during development. To make Roboto Flex production-ready for all print and digital media, Font Bureau expanded the glyph set with careful planning and
    development, in partnership with script experts for Cyrillic and Greek. Rigorous testing of each glyph across every axis required new type design tools to be developed, like typetools and videoproof,
    which can be used to explore the depth of the design.


    The final file size of the complete package is remarkably small, given the range of expressive styles now available. By driving variable fonts technology to its limits, it offers the most interesting and useful typographic tools for end users and designers.
    With a fully loaded Optical Size axis, Roboto Flex makes the layout of texts with deep hierarchies more straightforward and heightens the quality of every design that uses it.


    And none of this would be possible without the long list of contributors involved. Special thanks to David Berlow, Santiago Orozco, Ilya Ruderman, Irene Vlachou, Yury Ostromentsky, Mikhail Strukov, Dave Crossland, Damien Correll, Marc Foley, David Jonathan

Taviraj is a serif Latin and looped Thai typeface that has a wide structure that ensures readability and legibility. 
It is well-suited for formal usage. 
Thai letters have thick and thin strokes, similar to the Latin, together with rounded and airy looped terminals. 
Taviraj is a 9 weight family that includes italics. 


Taviraj is a Thai word that refers to the last two kings of Krungsri Ayutthaya, the former capital of Thailand. 
People also metaphorically refer to Taviraj as the fall of a dynasty, and that is the reason why it appeared in the poem written by King Rama V regarding the situation of Siam being threatened by French expansionism, with his majesty expressing his sorrow towards the possibility of the end of his era. 
A traditional Thai style of typeface is called “farangses,” which means french, and Taviraj is in this genre. This contradiction highlights its origin. 


A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ and ฎ ฏ is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. 
Taviraj takes a specific approach when dealing with the thick and thin strokes of Thai glyphs. 
Other type designers of Thai fonts may like to use this approach as a reference. 
Formal looped Thai typefaces have delicate details so care must be taken when expanding them to heavier weights, to retain all the details.
The size and position of Thai vowel and tone marks has been managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.

From the early 1930s through World War II, there were about 200 professional hand letterers working in New York City alone. This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs. Alejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of today’s designer. Extreme care has been taken to render the original scripts authentically, keeping the fictitious names originally assigned to them by Bluemlein.","{'different', 'original', 'professional', 'calligraphic', 'fictitious', 'graphic', 'complete'}",['Sudtipos']

Playfair is a transitional design. 
In the European Enlightenment in the late 18th century, broad nib quills were replaced by pointed steel pens as the popular writing tool of the day.
Together with developments in printing technology, ink, and paper making, it became to print letterforms of high contrast and delicate hairlines that were increasingly detached from the written letterforms.


This design lends itself to this period, and while it is not a revival of any particular design, it takes influence from the designs of John Baskerville and from ‘Scotch Roman’ designs.
Being a Display (large size) design in the transitional genre, functionally and stylistically it can accompany Georgia for body text.


This is the Small Cap sibling family to the main Playfair Display family. 
The main family downloaded font files include a full set of small caps, common ligatures, and discretionary ligatures.

Updated November 2017 with many small improvements and additional language support.

Tangerine is a calligraphic typeface inspired by many italic chancery hands from the 16th and 17th centuries. 
Its tall ascender, the most distinct characteristic of this type, takes a wide line space between lines and gives a graceful texture. 
Use Tangerine for titles or short texts at large sizes because of the short height of lowercase letters.

Abhaya Libre is the unicode compliant, complete libre version of the most widely used Sinhala typeface ‘FM Abhaya’ and includes Sinhala and Latin support. 
Designed in 1996, ‘FM Abhaya’ is an interpretation of the Sinhala letterpress typefaces from 1960s.
The name ‘Abhaya’ is derived from the King Abhaya (474 BCE to 454 BCE) who reigned Sri Lanka from the ancient kingdom of Upatissa Nuwara. 


‘Abhaya Libre’ was completely redrawn from scratch based on FM Abhaya to comply with modern day usages in terms of web, tab and smaller sizes for smartphones. 
Available in 5 weights, Abhaya Libre enables designers to build sophisticated typographic layouts by using lighter weights for body text and heavier weights for headlines and subheadings. 
Each of these weights contains 925 glyphs that enables clean and precise rendering for Sinhala, Pali and Sanskrit texts. 
Compact ‘Da’ forms can be enabled by using stylistic sets. 
The Latin characters, that match the aesthetics of ‘Abhaya Libre Sinhala’, which was inspired by the style of the original Sinhala with an eminent contrast between distinctive strokes that go from thick to thin and was further modified to co-exist with the visual logics of Latin typefaces. 
The ductus references according to the lines of a Didone typeface add a touch of Sinhala form to certain terminations. 
Large counters have been added along with small ascenders and descenders for optimized screen viewing.

Hind Vadodara is a family of five Gujarati fonts, which are part of the Indian Type Foundry’s larger Open Source Hind Multi-Script project. 
Hind Multi-Script is a type system providing nine stylistically-matching font families – one for each of the following writing systems used in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka: Bengali, Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, and Sinhala. 
In addition to Gujarati, the Hind Vadodara fonts also include Latin-script characters.


Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, Hind’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, paired with seemingly monolinear strokes. 
Most of these strokes have flat endings: they either terminate with a horizontal or a vertical shear, rather than on a diagonal. 
This helps create clear-cut counter forms between the characters. 
Additionally, Hind’s letterforms feature open apertures and counterforms. 
The entire family feels very legible when used to set text.


The Gujarati and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that the height of the Gujarati base characters is more or less at the same visual height that the Latin capital letters share. 
The exact height of the Gujarati characters increases vis à vis the capital height as the family increases in weight, just as the Latin lowercase does. 
Each font in the Hind Vadodara family has 851 glyphs, which include many unique Gujarati conjuncts. 
These ensure full support for the writing of the Gujarati language. 
The Latin component’s character set is Adobe Latin 3, which enables typesetting in English and the other Western European languages. 


Hind Vadodara is a solid alternate when choosing typefaces for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding. 
Hitesh Malaviya designed Hind Vadodara for ITF, who first published the fonts in 2015. 
Hind Vadodara is named after Vadodara, a city in Gujarat, India.

In the three or four years prior to the initial development of this font in June 2015, Jonny lived in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, working for Indian Type Foundry. 
During this time India had a profound effect on his design philosophy and general worldview. 
Shrikhand is the culmination of three years absorbing the colourful and vibrant hand-painted lettering that can be seen on the streets in Gujarat.

    range of optical sizes. While it was carefully crafted to work well in digital media, across the full scope of sizes and resolutions we have today, it is just as comfortable to read and work in print media.

  Libre Caslon Text is optimized for web body text (typically set at 16px), whilst the companion family
  Libre Caslon Display is optimized for web headlines.


  Libre Caslon Text was specifically tailored to be used for web body text (typically set at 16px). It can be used at very small sizes and will still be readable on your website.


  Another big difference is that pretty much all other digital Caslons revivals are based on 18th Century specimens by William Caslon I and William Caslon II. Libre Caslon, instead, is based on hand lettering artist Caslon interpretations typical of 1950s advertising.


  This font was upgraded in early 2020 and is now available as a variable font.

Mada is a modernist, unmodulted Arabic typeface inspired by road signage seen around Cairo, Egypt, by Khaled Hosny. 
The Arabic component is characterized by low descenders, open contours, and low contrast forms, making it suitable for signage, small point sizes, and user interfaces. 
However Mada can work also as a display typeface, with a modernist and simplistic feeling.
The Latin component is a slightly modified version of Source Sans Pro, led by Paul Hunt at Adobe Type.

The Display styles are low contrast and spaced tightly, with a large x-height and open counters. The Text styles have a slightly smaller x-height and narrower width for better legibility, are spaced more generously, and have thinned joins for better performance at small sizes. The two families can be used together seamlessly at a range of sizes.

Pragati Narrow is a libre Devanagari typeface family designed as a complement to Archivo Narrow. 
It is a sans-serif family with vertical and horizontal cuts. 
Pragati Narrow comes in 2 weights (Regular and Bold) and was specially developed for screen as webfont and desktop font, too. 
The Devanagari was designed by Marcela Romero, Pablo Cosgaya and Nicolás Silva. 
The Latin version of Pragati is reminiscent of late nineteenth century American typefaces. 
It includes four Narrow styles and four Normal styles (in development), was derived from Chivo (designed by Héctor Gatti) and was developed with the collaboration of the Omnibus-Type team.


Pragati (प्रगति) is the Hindi word for ‘progress’.

Lalezar is an Arabic and Latin display typeface for popular culture.


During the 1960s and 1970s a genre of filmmaking emerged in Iran which was commonly known as Film-Farsi. 
The main focus of the films produced in this period was on popular subjects such as romances, musicals and unrealistic heroic characters. 
The movie posters designed to represent these films were also intended to exaggerate these elements by the use of provocative imagery and a particular type of display lettering. 
These bold and dynamic letterforms were so popular and widely used that perhaps one can consider them the most significant component of film posters in that period. 


Lalezar is an attempt to revive the appealing qualities in this genre of lettering and transform them into a modern Arabic display typeface and a suitable Latin companion. 
Although the main inspiration comes from a style of lettering that was used to represent the Persian language, here the objective is to design a typeface that can be used for most of the languages that use the Arabic script for their written communication. 


The Lalezar project is led by Borna Izadpanah, a type designer based in London, UK.

Athiti is a Thai word for the Sun, and it is an informal sans Latin and loopless Thai typeface. 
The friendly personality is based on humanist calligraphy, and has an organic look and feel while preserving the traditional construction of Roman type. 
It all started with a desire to learn more about the origin of strokes in human handwriting. 
It is designed to reflect a trace of writing tools and convey its inspiration. 
The family consists of 6 weights that can be used in headlines or body text.


The outer curves contrast with the angled inner counter shapes, which distributes feelings of strength and softness at the same time. 
Athiti can be used with a mixture of formal and informal content, for example in educational work.


A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, or ข ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. 
A specific approach has been taken for dealing with thick and thin strokes in the Thai design. 
Other type designers may consider this font as an example when developing new fonts. 


Informal loopless Thai typefaces have slightly simplified details, as compared to the formal looped style, and this allows type designers to extend loopless families to very black weights.
Sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.
Also, in this case, ink trapping is required when connecting two specific strokes of each glyph, and it has to be done carefully, as it has been in Athiti.

I used a variety of tools, including Gimp, Python/PIL, and of course, FontForge.  The VT320 glyphs were designed with a nonrectangular pixel aspect ratio to fit the way the terminal scanned the CRT, so for this VT323 variation I had Python munge the locations and attempt to emulate the way the electron beam actually illuminated the phosphor and smeared the pixels horizontally on the terminal's CRT, so it looks more like what the actual glyph looked like on the screen. Python then drew the proper pixels into a 1:1 pixel grid as a monochrome PNG, which FontForge autoscanned into outlines.  I have attempted to support most of the glyphs available on the VT320, but that is a limited set to begin with, so please don't be disappointed that I haven't supported Esperanto or Riograndenser Hunsrückisch or whatever. There is another earlier variation called ""VT321"" that uses a more standard 1:1 pixel drawing technique, if you want to grab that as well.

Pridi means “joyful” in Thai. 
Pridi is a slab serif Latin and looped Thai typeface that is well-suited for both body text and display. 
The looped Terminal Thai is designed specifically within loopless terminal concepts, and works well with the slab serif Latin without adding any slabs to any Thai glyphs. 
This font can be used as a body text in various media such as magazines, advertisements, and other print media.


A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, and ข ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. 
Pridi has a specific approach to the thick and thin strokes of Thai glyphs. 
Other type designers of Thai fonts may like to use this approach as a reference. 
Informal looped Thai typefaces have slightly simplified details, as compared to formal ones, and this allows designers to extend the font to heavier weights. 
The size and position of Thai vowel and tone marks need to be managed carefully, because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.

This typeface design was inspired by Tim Holloway's Markazi typeface, with his encouragement, and initiated by Gerry Leonidas as a joint University of Reading and Google project.


The Arabic glyphs were designed by Borna Izadpanah and design directed by Fiona Ross, they feature a moderate contrast. It takes its cues from the award-winning Markazi typeface, affording a contemporary and highly readable typeface.


The complementary Latin glyphs were designed by Florian Runge. It keeps in spirit with its Arabic counterpart, echoing key design characteristics while being rooted in established Latin traditions. It is an open and clear design with a compact stance and an evenly flowing rhythm.


The family is available in four weights with extended language support suited for print and screen.

Petrona’s personality is an answer to how many characteristics can be added to a typeface without undermining its purpose within the text-type genre.
Petrona playfully maneuvers plenty of personal touches, without losing the essence of a design intended for legibility in digital and print media, from headlines to body text.
Uppercase glyphs have heavy asymmetric serifs and arms with inverted angles, which combine with lowercase designs that share a big x-height, pronounced ascenders, and soft curves of low stroke contrast.


First published in Google Fonts in November 2011 as a single style Roman design, it was completely redrawn in 2019 and 2020.
It has evolved, and now offers a comprehensive range of weights, a complete set of corresponding italics, and an extended glyph set that supports over 200 Latin languages.
A full set of small caps, plus ligatures, alternates, and all kinds of numerals, fractions, punctuations, symbols, and currencies are included.
As a variable font, it has a Weight axis in both the roman and italic files.
The previous swashy Q is still available, found in Stylistic Set 1.
It is now a typeface that supplies everything needed for fine text typography.

Hind Guntur is a family of five Telugu fonts, which are part of the Indian Type Foundry’s larger Open Source Hind Multi-Script project. 
In addition to Telugu, the Hind Guntur fonts also include Latin-script characters.


Developed explicitly for use in User Interface design, Hind Guntur’s letterforms have a humanist-style construction, paired with seemingly monolinear strokes.
Most strokes have flat endings: they either terminate with a horizontal or a vertical shear, rather than on a diagonal. 
This helps create clear-cut counter forms between the characters. 
Additionally, Hind Guntur’s letterforms feature open apertures and counterforms. 
The entire family feels very legible when used to set text.


Hind Guntur is a solid alternate when choosing typefaces for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding. 
Hind Guntur is named after Guntur, a city where Telugu is used.

    Fraunces is a Variable Font with four axes: Weight (wght), Optical Size (opsz), Softness (SOFT), and Wonky (WONK). The Softness axis controls the “wetness” or “inkiness” of the typeface. The Wonky axis controls the manual substitution of “wonky” characters,
    such as the lean of the h, n, and m glyphs in the Roman, and the flagged ball terminals of the b, d, h, k, l, v, and w glyphs of the Italic.

Rozha One,serif,407,rozha-one,400,['normal'],"traditional, elegant, trustworthy, formal, classic, established, reliable",character3,RozhaOne-Regular,rozhaone,2014.0,"Rozha One is a very high contrast Open Source font, which currently offers support for the Devanagari and Latin scripts. Created primarily for display use, the extreme difference between its letters’ thick and thin strokes make it an excellent choice for large headlines and poster-sized graphics. The Indian Type Foundry released Rozha One in 2014; its Devanagari character set was designed by Tim Donaldson and Jyotish Sonowal. Shiva Nallaperumal designed the Latin.
The font’s Latin characters are drawn in a fat face ‘modern’ or ‘Didone’ style, similar to letters that were commonly used in 19th century advertising posters in the West. Rozha One’s Latin characters barely differentiate between upper and lowercase letter sizes; the x-height of its lowercase letters is so high – and the size of its capital letters so small – that these virtually blend into one another in a line of text. Nevertheless, the Devanagari letters are drawn in such a way that they harmonise with the font’s Latin very well in settings where texts in multiple languages sit alongside one another. The headline of the Devanagari base characters is the same thickness as the Latin letters’ serifs. Certain Devanagari letter strokes and vowel marks bare visually similarity to the font’s Latin letters. However, Rozha One does not appear Latinized or un-Devanagari.
The font includes 1,095 glyphs, offering full support for the conjuncts and ligatures required by languages written with the Devanagari script. When used in on-screen design environments, Rozha One should be used in very large pixel sizes. However in print, the design may be used in a broader range of sizes, perhaps even as small as at 16 or 18 points.

Capriola is a sans-serif typeface whose unique style draws upon forms seen in handwriting and italic types. Skeletons of the most characteristic glyphs are inspired by quick handwriting and based on a single hand movement (G,a,g,k,e). Capriola ambitiously seeks to push the boundaries of originality in the genre without losing legibility.
The unusual glyphs are quite noticeable in large sizes which allows for distinctive headlines. However in small sizes these gestures become less noticeable making it possible to set longer texts. The name ""Capriola"" means somersault in English. Such glyphs as ""a"", ""e"" or ""G"" are the real acrobats and the ""g"" makes a double salto! Capriola was spaced for web. Capriola's originality combined with utility makes it ideal for a wide range of uses.

Tillana is a refreshingly informal family of typefaces for Devanagari and Latin.
The fonts were first published by the Indian Type Foundry as an open source project in 2014.
Coming in at 1,021 glyphs per weight, Tillana has all of the characters necessary to set a variety of European languages, as well as Indian languages like Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, and more.
The Tillana family includes five styles, which range in weight from Regular through Extra Bold.
Tillana’s Latin do not connect; this part of the family is a non-joining script type.
The Devanagari part is one of the few “true cursive” designs currently available for the script.


Characters from both writing systems appear as if they were fluidly handwritten, particularly the Devanagari.
Tillana’s letterforms are slanted at a 10 degree angle.
The strokes are show visible contrast, and the dynamic counter forms are one of the design’s most prominent features.
The forms involve many loops and hooks and most of the knots are loops rather than closed, black forms.
All vertical strokes in both scripts have swelling at their tops and bottoms, and the Devanagari characters’ central vertical strokes almost always break through the headline.
Handwriting artefacts are present in the Latin letters, too, such as hook on the descender of the lowercase q.


Tillana’s Devanagari base character height falls vertically between the Latin upper and lowercase letter heights.
The Latin characters have a small x-height and long ascenders and descenders.
Lipi Raval designed the Devanagari components of Tillana, and worked together with Jonny Pinhorn on the Latin.


This project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type foundry based in Ahmedabad, Gujurat, India, who design contemporary Indian typeface families.

The close companionship of Serif and Sans is achieved by a careful match of letter proportions and typographic color. Source Serif is loosely based on the work of Pierre Simon Fournier, and many idiosyncrasies typical to Fournier’s designs (like the bottom serif on the b or the middle serif on the w) are also found in Source Serif. Without being a pure historical revival, Source Serif takes cues from Fournier and reworks them for a modern age.
Both typeface families have different personalities because they spring from the hands of different designers: Source Serif was designed by Frank Grießhammer, Source Sans was designed by Paul Hunt. Robert Slimbach consulted on both designs, which helped maintain the overall family harmony. Either design feels confident on its own but also works in combination with the other — just like their designers do.
Source Serif continues Adobe’s line of high-quality open source typefaces. Designed for a digital environment, the letter shapes are simplified and highly readable. Its historical roots, combined with expert guidance give the typeface a strong character of its own that will shine when used for extended text on paper or screen.

While this project was heavily inspired by Claude Garamont's immortal legacy, Christian did not use any specific font as a starting point or direct reference for the designs. Most glyphs were drawn from scratch; when he needed guidance on a specific character, he searched for the term Garamond and skimmed through the results for a general impression.
He is grateful to the creative souls on the Typophile, TypeDrawers and Typografie forums, and Github, for a wealth of knowledge about type design, and for providing a large amount of excellent feedback on Cormorant during its development.

As a result, the Overlock typeface family is great for titles and short texts in magazine style layouts.

Lobster is one of the most popular web fonts, designed by Pablo Impallari. 
Pattaya is a version of Lobster extended into Thai, and supports Latin and all variations of the Thai script with an informal loopless design.
However, vertical metrics (that effect line-spacing) had to be adjusted in order to support Thai vowels and tone marks, so this is published as a separate family. 


A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ and ฏ, บ and ป, or ข and ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. 
Pattaya has a specific approach to the thick and thin strokes of Thai glyphs. 
Other type designers of Thai fonts may like to use this approach as a reference. 
Informal loopless Thai tyefaces have slightly simplified details, as compared to formal ones, and this simplification has to be done properly in order to preserve the character of each glyph.
The size and position of Thai vowel and tone marks need to be managed carefully, because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.

Trirong means “tricolor flag” in Thai, and represents the flag of Thailand.
A serif Latin and looped Thai typeface, it is characterized by thick and thin strokes, and its narrow and tall structure echoes that of traditional Thai typefaces. 
It saves space while preserving readability and legibility with its oval-shape looped terminal. 
This looped Thai and Transitional serif Latin works well in formal contexts. 


The similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, and ฎ and ฏ is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts. 
Trirong takes a specific approach in how it deals with the thick and thin strokes in Thai glyphs. 
Other type designers of Thai fonts may like to use this approach as a reference.
Formal looped Thai typefaces have delicate details, so it is important for type designers to take care when extending them into heavy weights and avoid obscuring important details. 
The sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully too, because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall texture.

Starting from those specifications, critical adjustments were made to the letterforms to create an optimal presentation at smaller sizes on-screen and later for display sizes, especially in the lighter weights.

Biryani (बिरयानी) is a libre font development project. 
Its fonts are designed in a monolinear, geometric sans serif style. 
Like several early geometric sans typefaces from the last century, Biryani’s characters have a strong flavor to them; they are more wonky than sterile. 
Biryani’s fonts are indeed meant for text, just not necessarily for very long, immersive reading-length passages. 
The letterforms are a bit too “display” for that. 


Currently, the Biryani fonts support the Latin and Devangari scripts, meaning that Indian languages like Hindi, Marathi, and Nepali may be set with the fonts, in addition to most Western and Central European languages.

Also, it provides freshness to the page while referring to the calligraphic letter, not as a literal interpretation, but rather in a contemporary typographic language.

Kiwi Maru was created mainly for use in digital devices, and I hope you will use it experimentally in your papers and reports.


The basic vocabulary of the Japanese language is divided into three categories: ""everyday words"", which are used freely in everyday conversation, articles and novels, ""written words"", which are used in official situations and sentences, and ""slang"", which is more informal in style.

　
Kiwi Maru Regular is a typeface for visualization and sharing of everyday and slang expressions in the digital age. Nowadays, in 2020, Mincho and Gothic typefaces are exclusively used in smart phones, tablets and PC environment. We hope that the introduction of a round font will change the way people express their emotions and feelings, which have been missing from the analog and digital worlds, and the painful feeling of having too many Chinese characters in a font.


There are three weights, L, R and M. These vary only slightly in weight as we wanted to provide you with the ability to account for the difference in weight between different OS, browsers, and devices.

text typeface families from various different historical periods, both
classical and contemporary. The idea was to design an average font for use in
text, through a lengthy process of shape measurement and data gathering in
spreadsheets. This resulted in a series of parameters which could be used by a
designer to determine the proportions, color, spacing and other attributes of
a typeface. Once the parameters were defined and best values were selected,
the forms for the Average Regular typeface were drawn.
In september 2022, Average has been updated to provide a larger glyphset and therefore greater language support.

A similarity between some glyphs such as ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ, ฎ ฏ, บ ป, or ข ช is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion when typesetting very short texts.

    A perfect blend of pointy paws in a coat of fur, Baloo is an affable display typeface by Ek Type.
    Available in nine Indian scripts plus Arabic along with a Latin counterpart, the family is Unicode compliant and
    libre licensed.


    Baloo 2 is an extension of the earlier Baloo project. The new Baloo 2 includes additional glyphs, engineering
    improvements, and has been extended to five weights, ranging from the light footed Regular to the affable ExtraBold.
    The lighter weights retain Baloo’s characteristic bounce, but they do so slightly, infusing life into each word.
    This allows the new family to freely fraternise with texts of all sizes and temperaments — be it short bursts or
    copious reams, demanding headlines or whispering bylines. Carefree yet confident, sprightly yet versatile, the
    renewed family of Baloo promises to bring warmth to every project.


    The Baloo 2 project consists of ten font families with unique
    local names for each of the nine Indic scripts plus Arabic (Baloo Bhaijaan 2). Each family supports one
    Indic/Arabic script plus Latin, Latin Extended, and Vietnamese.


    It took a team of committed type designers to rear Baloo and raise it to be the typeface we love. The Gurmukhi is
    designed by Shuchita Grover; Bangla by Noopur Datye and Sulekha Rajkumar; Odia by Yesha Goshar, Manish Minz, and
    Shuchita Grover; Gujarati by Noopur Datye and Supriya Tembe; Kannada by Divya Kowshik and Shuchita Grover; Telugu by
    Maithili Shingre and Omkar Shende; Malayalam by Maithili Shingre and Unnati Kotecha; and Tamil by Aadarsh Rajan.

Ovo was inspired by a set of hand lettered caps seen in a 1930's lettering guide. The capitals suggested the time in which they were made because of the soft serif treatment used. This detail and a subtle casual feeling creeping into the otherwise classical forms led to the soft genial lowercase and the whimsical numbers now seen in Ovo. Ovo is a medium contrast serif font. Because of the old style variable letter widths and subtle detail it will work best at medium to large sizes.

B612 is an highly legible open source font family, designed and tested to be used on aircraft cockpit screens.
Its design makes it particularly suitable for degraded contexts (ensuring legibility and readability of data), with a positive effect on reducing visual fatigue and cognitive load. 
Particular attention was given to the uniformity of the typeface, whether being used for isolated terms, reading information on a map, mixing capital letters and numbers, waypoint lists, long or abbreviated texts, specific terms and data in the aeronautical field.


In 2010, Airbus initiated a research collaboration with ENAC and Université de Toulouse III on a prospective study to define and validate an “Aeronautical Font”: the challenge was to improve the display of textual data information on all cockpit screens, concerning more specifically legibility, readability and reading comfort, and to enhance the overall cockpit consistency. 
The typographical research was conducted through iterations from experimentation to design. 
Two years later, Airbus came to Intactile DESIGN in order to design and develop the eight variants of the font. 
Baptized B612 in reference to the imaginary asteroid of the aviator Antoine de Saint‑Exupéry, the font has been optimised following a calligraphic approach, in order to preserve the readable qualities of humanist typefaces like réales and incises, but also the technical and functional image of sans serif or bitmap.


B612 is a two-weight font family including roman and italic styles but also a monospaced variation, B612 Mono. 
It was designed in 2012 by Nicolas Chauveau, Thomas Paillot and Jonathan Favre-Lamarine from the design agency Intactile DESIGN, and Jean-Luc Vinot from ENAC (French National University of Civil Aviation) Interactive Informatics Team for Laurent Spaggiari from the Airbus Human Factors department — prior research by Jean‑Luc Vinot (DGAC/DSNA) and Sylvie Athènes (Université de Toulouse III). 
In 2017, Airbus agreed to publish the font with an open source license (Eclipse Public License) within the Polarsys project, an industry-oriented project hosted by the Eclipse foundation. 
B612 project was awarded the Observeur du Design: Industry Star in 2018.


Updated 2019-03: Updated to latest upstream release.


The B612 project is led by Polarsys, an Eclipse Working Group created by large industry players and by tools providers to collaborate on the creation and support of Open Source tools for the development of embedded systems.

Bentham is inspired by the lettering of nineteenth-century maps, gravestones and the maker’s plates of cast-iron machinery. 
It is characterized by expressive, flowing, and bulging curves, mannered awkwardness, and the bobbles on the terminals of its characters. 
The ‘modern face’ type genre is the typographical equivalent, and it can be found in books printed throughout the nineteenth century. 
This genre survived in educational textbooks produced throughout the twentieth century, and is preserved in computer science as the style which Donald Knuth adopted for his TEX typesetting system.


Bentham is a half-way design; 
true neither to the type produced during the nineteenth century, nor to the letterforms of cartographers, stonecutters, or engravers. 
Really it is an examination of the characteristics that these letters share, colored by Ben's approach to type drawing.

Most glyphs were drawn from scratch; when he needed guidance on a specific character, he searched for the term Garamond and skimmed through the results for a general impression.

He is grateful to the creative souls on the Typophile, TypeDrawers and Typografie forums, and Github, for a wealth of knowledge about type design, and for providing a large amount of excellent feedback on Cormorant during its development. 
He also thanks the tireless folks at Glyphs, in particular Rainer Erich Scheichelbauer of Schriftlabor and Georg Seifert. 
Special thanks go to Dave Crossland and Google Fonts for making the libre release of this font family possible through generous funding of the development process.

The Cormorant project is led by Christian Thalmann, a type designer based in Zurich, Switzerland.

    weights and widths by multiple designers. A well-informed, conscientious and refreshing interpretation of India’s
    letter traditions, this family offers a versatile system that can meet the demands of a wide range of applications.

 Its expansive design space allows Anek to don multiple personalities. At its most condensed, capsular forms keep
    structures compact for that graphic texture. On the wide end of the spectrum, the extra legroom lets each letter
    yawn and stretch into their message. But it is in the boldest weights that Anek comes alive. Sharp terminals and
    tapered joineries sparkle amidst regimented forms, making this ideal for setting titillating headlines or that
    magnetic word-mark.
 Anek comes in ten scripts: Bangla, Devanagari, Kannada, Latin, Gujarati, Gurmukhi,
    Malayalam, Odia, Tamil and Telugu. The shared aesthetics of this type-family are drawn from a collaboratively
    decided pool of visual features. At the same time, each script amalgamates influences from its own typographic
    culture as well as the perspectives of individual designers. 
 This project is designed, engineered and maintained by Ek Type; a collective of type designers based in Mumbai
    focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces. Contributors of this project are: Maithili Shingre (Anek
    Malayalam, Anek Kannada), Yesha Goshar (Anek Latin, Anek Odia), Kailash Malviya (Anek Devanagari), Aadarsh Rajan

Google has worked with Monotype to release the 3 book weights (Regular, Medium and Bold) under the SIL Open Font License and create a new version for use by the public.
This project includes working with the David Hadash sources to create a new version, that fits the requirements of Israeli instituions, since David is the official font for Israeli correspondence.
Some glyphs were updated, such as the Sheqel symbol. It was redesigned to be recognizable by contemporary Hebrew readers, since the original Sheqel symbol is too far from today's standard.
Latin characters from the Gentium typeface were derived and integrated to accommodate cases in which Latin and Hebrew characters will be used in tandem.
Each font includes OpenType features required for diacritic marks (nikud) and Hebrew-specific uses, including alternative Hebrew-height numerals (available as Stylistic Set 1) an alternative ""Hebrew ampersand"" symbol designed by Ismar David (available in Stylistic Set 2) and an alternative Sheqel symbol designed by Ismar David (available in Stylistic Set 3.)
Every effort was made to keep the original designs intact, and the type's original spacing is well preserved. However, several changes have been made to fit with David Libre's goal to be used as a free alternative to the David font commonly installed on PCs. In order to be compatible with documents previously set in the version of David bundled with Microsoft Windows, David Hadash's glyph size has been reduced by 12.5%. This was made to prevent cases in which documents previously typed in Microsoft's David to take up more pages and cause odd line breaks. Please note that this does not guarantee full compatibility with that David, only a close approximation.
Diacritic marks have been repositioned. Biblical cantillation marks are not supported.
The construction of David Libre was made by Meir Sadan, commissioned by Google for the Google Fonts project.

Kadwa,serif,638,kadwa,"400,700",['normal'],"traditional, elegant, trustworthy, formal, classic, established, reliable",character3,"Kadwa-Bold,Kadwa-Regular",kadwa,2015.0,"
Kadwa is a Devanagari typeface family designed by Sol Matas. 
It is based on the original Latin typeface Bitter, a slab serif typeface for text.


People read and interact with text on screens more and more each day. 
What happens on screen ends up being more important than what comes out of the printer. 
With the accelerating popularity of electronic books, type designers are working hard to seek out the ideal designs for reading on screen.


Motivated by Sol's love for the pixel she designed Bitter, and later Kadwa.
A ""contemporary"" slab serif typeface for text, it is specially designed for comfortably reading on any computer or device. 
The robust design started from the austerity of the pixel grid, based on rational rather than emotional principles. 
It combines the large x-heights and legibility of the humanistic tradition with subtle characteristics in the characters that inject a certain rhythm to flowing texts.


It has little variation in stroke weight and the Regular is darker than a typical typeface intended for use in print.
This generates an intense color in paragraphs, accentuated by the serifs that are as thick as strokes, with square terminals.


Each glyph is carefully designed with an excellent curve quality added to the first stage of the design, that was entirely made in a pixel grid. 
The typeface is balanced and manually spaced to use very few kerning pairs, especially important for web font use since most browsers do not currently support this feature.


The Kadwa project is led by Sol Matas, a type designer based in Berlin, Germany.

Andika is a sans serif, Unicode-compliant font designed especially for literacy use, taking into account the needs of beginning readers. 
The focus is on clear, easy-to-perceive letterforms that will not be readily confused with one another.


Starting with an initial draft of a basic lowercase Latin alphabet by Victor Gaultney, Annie Olsen refined the design and added over 4,700 glyphs, including a complete extended Cyrillic set.


A sans serif font is preferred by some literacy personnel for teaching people to read. 
Its forms are simpler and less cluttered than those of most serif fonts. 
For years, literacy workers have had to make do with fonts that were not really suitable for beginning readers and writers. 
In some cases, literacy specialists have had to tediously assemble letters from a variety of fonts in order to get all of the characters they need for their particular language project, resulting in confusing and unattractive publications. 
Andika addresses those issues.


The font has been upgraded in May 2022. This upgrade gives additional weight styles and expands the glyphset to support full Latin and Cyrillic characters sets. Rendering is also much improved.

The old posters and signs in the traditional Montserrat neighborhood of Buenos Aires inspired Julieta to design this typeface and rescue the beauty of urban typography that emerged in the first half of the twentieth century. 
As urban development changes that place, it will never return to its original form and loses forever the designs that are so special and unique. 
The letters that inspired this project have work, dedication, care, color, contrast, light and life, day and night! 
These are the types that make the city look so beautiful.
The Montserrat Project began with the idea to rescue what is in Montserrat and set it free under a libre license, the SIL Open Font License.


This is the Subrayada family, a sister to the normal and Alternates families. 
Many of the letterforms are special in the Alternates family, while 'Subrayada' means 'Underlined' in Spanish and celebrates a special style of underline that is integrated into the letterforms found in the Montserrat neighborhood.


Updated November 2017: The family was redrawn by Jacques Le Bailly at Baron von Fonthausen over the summer, and the full set of weights were adjusted to make the Regular lighter and better for use in longer texts. 
In fall, Julieta Ulanovsky, Sol Matas, and Juan Pablo del Peral, led the development of Cyrillic support, with consultation with Carolina Giovagnoli, Maria Doreuli, and Alexei Vanyashin.

Radley is based on lettering originally drawn and designed for woodcarved titling work.
It was later digitized and extended to be used on the web.
Radley is a practical face, based on letterforms used by hand carvers who cut letters quickly, efficiently, and with style.
It can be used for both titling and text typography.


The basic letterforms in Radley grew out of sketching and designing directly into wood with traditional carving chisels.
These were scanned and traced into FontForge and cleaned up digitally, then the character set was expanded.
There is something unique about carving letters into wood with traditional hand tools, and hopefully Radley carries some of the original spirit of these hand carved letterforms.


Since the initial launch in 2012, Radley was updated by Vernon Adams adding an Italic and support for more Latin languages.
He made many glyph refinements throughout the family based on user feedback.
In 2017 the family was updated by Marc Foley to complete the work started by Vernon.

Since 1668 he spent his life creating a ‘learned press’ in Oxford, endowed with invaluable equipment, setting a high standard for the future of his publishing. He wrote: ""The foundation of all successe must be layd in doing things well, and I am sure that will not be don with English letters"" (to Jenkins, 2 Dec. 1672). So he collectected types available in the foreign market: mainly France, Holland and Germany. Fell decided to develop types in its own ‘workhouse’ too.Peter De Walpergen became his personal type-founder. Says Harry Carter in “THE FELL TYPES. What has been done in and about them” (Oxford University Press, New York, 1968): ""He was born at Frankfurt am Main, descended from a Protestant refugee from Antwerp. He was engaged by the Dutch East India Company in 1671 to work as a type-founder and printer in Java. The comparative crudity of his letter design makes it seems unlikely that he had been trained to cut punches.""John Fell entrusted him with the cut of the larger bodies: Great Primer Roman and Italic; Double Pica Roman and Italic; French Canon Roman and Italic; Three Lines Pica Roman. De Walpergen cut other types and letters for existing types to be harmonized with the larger bodies. Commented Morison: ""The design of these large Fell Types is difficult to characterize and impossible wholly to approve. It has some affinity with the Dutch work of the second half of the seventeenth century, especially with the bigger size of type shown in the Widow Elsevier’s specimen-sheet of types attributed to Christoffel van Dyck; but De Walpergen went much further in the contrasting weight of thick and thin strokes and his design has crudities about it of which Van Dyck would not have been capable.""In 1686 John Fell died. In his “will” he bequeathed the entire collection of type to the University of Oxford. Remembers Morison: ""This entire collection of ‘founding Materialls of Punchions Matrices Moulds’ was ‘got together’ by John Fell ‘and others at great expense’. Fell’s instructions that they ‘be carefully kept together’ by his executors were duly observed. The Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Oxford honourably played their part in sustaining the interests of ‘learning and printing’ and thus the collection was not dissipated but manteined entire.""","{'foreign', 'capable', 'personal', 'entire', 'impossible', 'invaluable', 'special', 'larger', 'bigger', 'available', 'possible', 'second', 'difficult'}",['Igino Marini']

    Hahmlet is inspired by a poster for the Korean ‘Hamlet’ movie from the 1940’s, created by an unknown letterer. The distinct and sharp, quirky and attention seeking details inspired Minjoo Ham to use it for a rather uncommon revival project and turn it into a robust, contemporary typeface. Once the Hangeul was finished, Mark Frömberg took on the challenge to translate the characteristics to the Latin design. A lively exploration into the possible and impossible began. Hahmlet is great for any kind of typesetting, print or screen but also a perfect eyecatcher for signage and poster designs. We highly recommend to use it for Hangeul and Latin bilingual typography.

During the 1990s the magazine and font catalogue Emigre was at the public front of typeface design, and was a place where computer fonts with this same look appeared.

The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs.

B612 is an highly legible open source font family, designed and tested to be used on aircraft cockpit screens. 
Its design makes it particularly suitable for degraded contexts (ensuring legibility and readability of data), with a positive effect on reducing visual fatigue and cognitive load. 
Particular attention was given to the uniformity of the typeface, whether being used for isolated terms, reading information on a map, mixing capital letters and numbers, waypoint lists, long or abbreviated texts, specific terms and data in the aeronautical field.


In 2010, Airbus initiated a research collaboration with ENAC and Université de Toulouse III on a prospective study to define and validate an “Aeronautical Font”: the challenge was to improve the display of textual data information on all cockpit screens, concerning more specifically legibility, readability and reading comfort, and to enhance the overall cockpit consistency. 
The typographical research was conducted through iterations from experimentation to design. 
Two years later, Airbus came to Intactile DESIGN in order to design and develop the eight variants of the font. 
Baptized B612 in reference to the imaginary asteroid of the aviator Antoine de Saint‑Exupéry, the font has been optimised following a calligraphic approach, in order to preserve the readable qualities of humanist typefaces like réales and incises, but also the technical and functional image of sans serif or bitmap.


B612 is a two-weight font family including roman and italic styles but also a monospaced variation, B612 Mono. 
It was designed in 2012 by Nicolas Chauveau, Thomas Paillot and Jonathan Favre-Lamarine from the design agency Intactile DESIGN, and Jean-Luc Vinot from ENAC (French National University of Civil Aviation) Interactive Informatics Team for Laurent Spaggiari from the Airbus Human Factors department — prior research by Jean‑Luc Vinot (DGAC/DSNA) and Sylvie Athènes (Université de Toulouse III). 
In 2017, Airbus agreed to publish the font with an open source license (Eclipse Public License) within the Polarsys project, an industry-oriented project hosted by the Eclipse foundation. 
B612 project was awarded the Observeur du Design: Industry Star in 2018.


Updated 2019-03: Updated to latest upstream release.


The B612 project is led by Polarsys, an Eclipse Working Group created by large industry players and by tools providers to collaborate on the creation and support of Open Source tools for the development of embedded systems.

Jomhuria is a dark Persian/Arabic and Latin display typeface, suitable for headline and other display usage.


The name means 'republic,' and the spark of inspiration for the design was a stencil of “Shablon” showing just a limited character set just for the Persian language without any marks, vowels or Latin glyphs.
Shablon was designed 30 years ago in Iran, and is reinterpreted by Kourosh to incorporate contemporary techniques, aesthetics and of course some personal taste.
While inspired by the spirit of Shablon, Jomhuria is a new typeface that stands on its own.
The typeface designer Kourosh created an additional original Latin design that is tailored to harmonize with the aesthetics of the Persian/Arabic design.


Being made for big sizes means details matter.
The positions of the dots remains faithful to their locations in Persian/Arabic calligraphy;
this is an important factor of beauty in the writing system and is key to readability.


The Arabic script was designed by Kourosh Beigpour, and the Latin was designed by Eben Sorkin.
The font is engineered by Lasse Fister, and the technicalities build upon those developed by Khaled Hosny for his “Amiri.”


The Latin is scaled to work best with the Arabic component.

Aboreto has vertical stress, a feature more typical of later-century typefaces. Another uniqueness lies in the construction, because it is essentially a sans-serif typeface that has only occasional indication of serifs – either via the “hidden” serifs caused by stroke tapering or by slightly thickening the stroke endings.

Voces is a new graphic solution for the glyphs of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), considering the specific use-case of bilingual dictionaries. 
For this purpose, the typeface was conceived as a sans serif with gradual strokes, generous counterforms, a large ""x"" height, and short ascenders and descenders. 
These features attempt to solve the problems of spatial economy and print fidelity that dictionary typesetting presents. 
Ink traps were applied with consideration for the aesthetic and functional requirements. 
Voces was selected for exhibition in Tipos Latinos 2010.


Voces is designed by Ana Paula Megda and Pablo Ugerman.

    Amiri (أميري) is a classical Arabic typeface in Naskh style for typesetting books and
    other running text.

  
    Amiri is a revival of the beautiful typeface pioneered in early 20th century by
    Bulaq Press in Cairo, also known as Amiria Press, after which the font is
    named.

    
    The uniqueness of this typeface comes from its superb balance between the
    beauty of Naskh calligraphy on one hand, the constraints and requirements of
    elegant typography on the other. Also, it is one of the few metal typefaces
    that were used in typesetting the Koran, making it a good source for a digital
    typeface to be used in typesetting Koranic verses.

    
    Amiri project aims at the revival of the aesthetics and traditions of Arabic
    typesetting, and adapting it to the era of digital typesetting, in a publicly
    available form.

Modak is a sweet plump Devanagari+Latin display typeface with portly curves and thin counters. 
It is Unicode compliant and is open sourced under the SIL Open Font License v1.1.


Modak began as a heavy hand-sketched letterform exploration in Devanagari with cute, adorable characters whose curves merged into each other, forming distinct counter shapes. 
As we translated these into a functional font, each character was fine-tuned and multiple matras designed to match precisely with every character. 
Unlike the conventional approach the post-base matras in Modak overlap the consonants. 
Likewise overlapping ukars were also designed leaving thin counters in between. 
Rather than being a mere composite of 2 separate glyphs, every conjunct was redrawn as a single entity. 
The challenge was to maintain legibility and consistency in the thin white counter spaces across all characters irrespective of their structural complexity. 


The resulting typeface is one of its kind and most likely the chubbiest Devanagari typeface to be designed so far.
Modak Devanagari is designed by Sarang Kulkarni and Maithili Shingre and Modak Latin by Noopur Datye with support from Girish Dalvi. 


We are immensely thankful to Santosh Kshirsagar, Pradnya Naik and Yashodeep Gholap for their suggestions and feedback during the font design process. 
We are also grateful to our friends from the Industrial Design Centre, IIT Bombay and Sir J J Institute of Applied Art for their support and encouragement.

The project currently comprises a total of 45 font files spanning 9 different visual styles (Roman, Italic, Infant, Infant Italic, Garamond, Garamond Italic, Upright Cursive, Small Caps, and Unicase) and 5 weights (Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold, and Bold.) Cormorant was conceived, drawn, spaced, kerned, programmed, interpolated, and produced in its entirety by Christian Thalmann of Catharsis Fonts. For an illustrated presentation and description of the family, please visit its Bēhance page.
While this project was heavily inspired by Claude Garamont's immortal legacy, Christian did not use any specific font as a starting point or direct reference for the designs. Most glyphs were drawn from scratch; when he needed guidance on a specific character, he searched for the term Garamond and skimmed through the results for a general impression.
He is grateful to the creative souls on the Typophile, TypeDrawers and Typografie forums, and Github, for a wealth of knowledge about type design, and for providing a large amount of excellent feedback on Cormorant during its development. He also thanks the tireless folks at Glyphs, in particular Rainer Erich Scheichelbauer of Schriftlabor and Georg Seifert. Special thanks go to Dave Crossland and Google Fonts for making the libre release of this font family possible through generous funding of the development process.

    A perfect blend of pointy paws in a coat of fur, Baloo is an affable display typeface by Ek Type.
    Available in nine Indian scripts plus Arabic along with a Latin counterpart, the family is Unicode compliant and
    libre licensed.


    Baloo 2 is an extension of the earlier Baloo project. The new Baloo 2 includes additional glyphs, engineering
    improvements, and has been extended to five weights, ranging from the light footed Regular to the affable ExtraBold.
    The lighter weights retain Baloo’s characteristic bounce, but they do so slightly, infusing life into each word.
    This allows the new family to freely fraternise with texts of all sizes and temperaments — be it short bursts or
    copious reams, demanding headlines or whispering bylines. Carefree yet confident, sprightly yet versatile, the
    renewed family of Baloo promises to bring warmth to every project.


    The Baloo 2 project consists of ten font families with unique
    local names for each of the nine Indic scripts plus Arabic (Baloo Bhaijaan 2). Each family supports one
    Indic/Arabic script plus Latin, Latin Extended, and Vietnamese.


    It took a team of committed type designers to rear Baloo and raise it to be the typeface we love. The Gurmukhi is
    designed by Shuchita Grover; Bangla by Noopur Datye and Sulekha Rajkumar; Odia by Yesha Goshar, Manish Minz, and
    Shuchita Grover; Gujarati by Noopur Datye and Supriya Tembe; Kannada by Divya Kowshik and Shuchita Grover; Telugu by
    Maithili Shingre and Omkar Shende; Malayalam by Maithili Shingre and Unnati Kotecha; and Tamil by Aadarsh Rajan.

With Indian typefaces, large character sets are often even less common. The Indian Type Foundry’s font families have been an exception, however. Sarpanch continues this trend. Sarpanch is an Open Source typeface supporting the Devanagari and Latin scripts. It was designed for use in large point sizes and pixel sizes. Sarpanch’s letterforms are made up of strokes with a high contrast. They are also drawn with wide proportions, based on a squared construction principle.
Six fonts make up the Sarpanch family, ranging in weight from Regular to Black. As weight increases along the family’s axis, vertical strokes become thicker, but the typeface’s horizontals retain the same thickness across each weight. While the rather wide Regular weight of the family is almost monolinear, the Black weight appears to have a very high degree of contrast.
The Regular, Medium and Semibold fonts are recommended for use in short headlines, while Bold, Heavy and Black are intended primarily for setting single words or pairs. At display sizes, Sarpanch works equally well on screen or in print. Each font contains 1035 glyphs and offers full support for the conjuncts and ligatures required by languages written in the Devanagari script.
The Medium–Black weights of the Sarpanch family were design by Manushi Parikh at ITF in 2014. Jyotish Sonowal designed the Regular weight. Sarpanch is an excellent choice for use in advertising or for news tickers on television screens (breaking news, etc.) In Hindi, the word Sarpanch means ‘the head of a village’.

Sumana is a family of Latin and Devanagari fonts for text setting and web usage. 
Designed by Alexei Vanyashin in 2014-2015 for Cyreal.


The Latin counterpart is derived from Lora by Olga Karpushina, Cyreal. 
Its vertical and horizontal metrics are adjusted to better match with the Devanagari. 
The meaning of Sumana in Sanskrit is flower, which is the meaning of Lora in Spanish. 
It was quite a challenge to match the graphical characteristics of each script and took many iterations to finalise the first release. 
I tried to keep the Devanagari closer to a traditional Indian calligraphic model while flavouring it with graphic solutions derived from Lora's Latin. 


It is my first attempt to design a Devanagari, and I am thankful to Google Fonts for making this project happen, and to all experts who consulted with me on this project, including: 
Fiona Ross, Eric McLaughlin, Vaishnavi Murthy, Pria Ravichandran, and Wei Huang. 
The comments and revision history can be found in this discussion in the Google Fonts forum.


This project is led by Cyreal, an international type foundry focused on designing contemporary Latin and Cyrillic typefaces.

It is based on Peter Wiegel’s font Koch fette deutsche Schrift which is in turn based on a 1910 typeface by Rudolf Koch. While the glyph design of Peter Wiegel’s font has hardly been changed at all, UnifrakturCook uses smart font technologies for displaying the font’s ligatures (OpenType, Apple Advanced Typography and SIL Graphite). An experimental feature is the distinction of good blackletter typography between required ligatures ‹ch, ck, ſt, tz› that must be kept when letterspacing is increased, and regular ligatures (for instance, ‹fi, fl›) that are broken up when letterspacing is increased. Using the ligatures: Whenever you type a sequence such as ‹tz›, it will automatically be displayed as a ligature. When you want to oppress a ligature, for instance in the German word «Zeitzone» ‘time zone’ that should have no tz-ligature, then you put a zero width non-joiner between the ‹t› and the ‹z› or, alternatively, you write «Zeit&zwnj;zone» in the HTML code. Unfortunately, this will only work on a browser that is capable of displaying ligatures. Of course, UnifrakturMaguntia provides the character ‹ſ› (U+017F LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S)! UnifrakturCook is optimized for @font-face linking on the internet by combining standards compliance with a permissive license. UnifrakturCook has first been published in 2010 at UnifrakturCook. It has been edited with FontForge, the libre outline font editor. OpenType features have been added with FontForge directly. AAT features have been added with ftxenhancer of the Apple Font Tools.

Rotund curves, large loops and voluminous counters. Gotu reimagines Devanagari calligraphy while at the same time reinterprets what high contrast Latin typefaces can be. Though the Devanagari is penned with a traditional canted nib, the structures are improvised with an expressive whim that belies conventions of structure and challenges notions of consistency. Swooping calligraphic strokes inspire forms that are lyrical without being too opulent. The same spirit resonates within a modulated sans serif style Latin as letters retain a calligraphic stress and keep the delicate typographic quirks. Furnished with such typographic subtleties, Gotu can lend its distinct style to a quaint monograph, a striking headline, an ornate invite or even a chic brand.

    Baloo 2 is an extension of the earlier Baloo project. The new Baloo 2 includes additional glyphs, engineering
    improvements, and has been extended to five weights, ranging from the light footed Regular to the affable ExtraBold.
    The lighter weights retain Baloo’s characteristic bounce, but they do so slightly, infusing life into each word.
    This allows the new family to freely fraternise with texts of all sizes and temperaments — be it short bursts or
    copious reams, demanding headlines or whispering bylines. Carefree yet confident, sprightly yet versatile, the
    renewed family of Baloo promises to bring warmth to every project.


    The Baloo 2 project consists of ten font families with unique
    local names for each of the nine Indic scripts plus Arabic (Baloo Bhaijaan 2). Each family supports one
    Indic/Arabic script plus Latin, Latin Extended, and Vietnamese.


    It took a team of committed type designers to rear Baloo and raise it to be the typeface we love. The Gurmukhi is
    designed by Shuchita Grover; Bangla by Noopur Datye and Sulekha Rajkumar; Odia by Yesha Goshar, Manish Minz, and

 Its expansive design space allows Anek to don multiple personalities. At its most condensed, capsular forms keep
    structures compact for that graphic texture. On the wide end of the spectrum, the extra legroom lets each letter
    yawn and stretch into their message. But it is in the boldest weights that Anek comes alive. Sharp terminals and
    tapered joineries sparkle amidst regimented forms, making this ideal for setting titillating headlines or that
    magnetic word-mark.
 Anek comes in ten scripts: Bangla, Devanagari, Kannada, Latin, Gujarati, Gurmukhi,
    Malayalam, Odia, Tamil and Telugu. The shared aesthetics of this type-family are drawn from a collaboratively
    decided pool of visual features. At the same time, each script amalgamates influences from its own typographic

Initially I designed the ""New Folk"" for use in a poster, with only uppercase letters. 
I saw at the start some potential for a typeface that could recall the feelings of the writing used day-to-day in my city's informal communication, and developed it into a typeface family with lowercases too. 
This is the Londrina Outline member of the Londrina family.

Asar is an original Devanagari and Latin typeface that is based on an expanding brush stroke following a heart line. 
The design is meant to work well with long texts while maintaining a certain charm at large sizes.
Asar is partially derived from Pria Ravichadran's Palanquin, starting by interpreting that design's overall proportions and heart lines and glyph set and OpenType features.


The design arrives at its own identity by adjusting for the density of certain brush strokes, that dictate wider spacing and new forms.
The brush used is the Expand Path feature of Fontlab Studio 5, using a width of 93, an angle of -55, and a roundness of 35.
In general the letters are designed so as to not require further adjustment, but where this is not satisfying then manual adjustments are made.

    A perfect blend of pointy paws in a coat of fur, Baloo is an affable display typeface by Ek Type.
    Available in nine Indian scripts plus Arabic along with a Latin counterpart, the family is Unicode compliant and
    libre licensed.


    Baloo 2 is an extension of the earlier Baloo project. The new Baloo 2 includes additional glyphs, engineering
    improvements, and has been extended to five weights, ranging from the light footed Regular to the affable ExtraBold.
    The lighter weights retain Baloo’s characteristic bounce, but they do so slightly, infusing life into each word.
    This allows the new family to freely fraternise with texts of all sizes and temperaments — be it short bursts or
    copious reams, demanding headlines or whispering bylines. Carefree yet confident, sprightly yet versatile, the
    renewed family of Baloo promises to bring warmth to every project.


    The Baloo 2 project consists of ten font families with unique
    local names for each of the nine Indic scripts plus Arabic (Baloo Bhaijaan 2). Each family supports one
    Indic/Arabic script plus Latin, Latin Extended, and Vietnamese.


    It took a team of committed type designers to rear Baloo and raise it to be the typeface we love. The Gurmukhi is
    designed by Shuchita Grover; Bangla by Noopur Datye and Sulekha Rajkumar; Odia by Yesha Goshar, Manish Minz, and
    Shuchita Grover; Gujarati by Noopur Datye and Supriya Tembe; Kannada by Divya Kowshik and Shuchita Grover; Telugu by
    Maithili Shingre and Omkar Shende; Malayalam by Maithili Shingre and Unnati Kotecha; and Tamil by Aadarsh Rajan.

    Tiro Devanagari Hindi has its origins in a typeface designed for the Murty Classical Library of India book series, so is especially suited to traditional literary publishing but also made with the needs of today’s multiple print and screen media in mind.
    The Tiro Devanagari design applies a contemporary approach to the traditional styling of 19th and 20th Century metal types exemplified in those of the renowned Nirnaya Sagar Press, and is characterised by broader proportions, more generous counters,
    and strong diagonal strokes and terminals. The Hindi font balances traditional and modern forms of conjuncts. For the Open Font License release, Tiro Devanagari Hindi has been extended to support additional characters, and features a new italic companion.
    Each font also includes a Latin subset including diacritics for transcription of Indian languages.


    Tiro Devanagari Hindi was designed by John Hudson and Fiona Ross. The italic was adapted by Paul Hanslow.

    the turn of the century. The result is a neutral yet friendly Grotesque style typeface that balances design with the
    engineered details that make Plex distinctly IBM. The
    family includes a Sans, Sans Condensed, Mono, and Serif and has excellent legibility in print, web, and mobile
    interfaces.


    Plex’s three designs work well independently and even better together. Use the Sans as a
    contemporary compadre, the Serif for editorial storytelling, or the Mono to show code snippets. The unexpectedly
    expressive nature of the italics gives you even more options for your designs. Currently, IBM Plex Sans supports
    Extended Latin, Arabic, Cyrillic, Devanagari, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean and Thai.

I’d been studying sans serif type as a project on the Typography & Graphic Communication course that I was taking at Reading University, and learning about the different strands of development: ‘grotesques’ such as the delightful Monotype Series 215 were designed by type cutters or draftsmen, while geometric and humanist sans serifs like Futura and Gill Sans were constructed with compasses or quills by rationalist typographers and calligraphers. In the end, of course, they all needed a little wash and brush-up from the typefounder – to say nothing of the type designs. I was also in thrall of a typeface called Ehrhardt, a Monotype revival typeface that is based on a seventeenth century design by Miklos Kis. It too had endured a lot of cleaning, but though they were hard on the source material, those responsible created a very elegant condensed typeface. The result looks a bit like a house on an Amsterdam canal. Puritan was my response to these influences; it was also a way (I thought) that I could get hold of an interesting typeface without unofficially borrowing from the Typography department. It might be flawed, but it was mine! Well, I learned a lot from the experience. I wrote a short essay about Puritan as a project in my final year as an undergraduate. Rather than repeat it all here, I have converted the essay (presented as a booklet) into  a PDF file of around 1200K which you can download.

 Its expansive design space allows Anek to don multiple personalities. At its most condensed, capsular forms keep
    structures compact for that graphic texture. On the wide end of the spectrum, the extra legroom lets each letter
    yawn and stretch into their message. But it is in the boldest weights that Anek comes alive. Sharp terminals and
    tapered joineries sparkle amidst regimented forms, making this ideal for setting titillating headlines or that
    magnetic word-mark.
 Anek comes in ten scripts: Bangla, Devanagari, Kannada, Latin, Gujarati, Gurmukhi,
    Malayalam, Odia, Tamil and Telugu. The shared aesthetics of this type-family are drawn from a collaboratively
    decided pool of visual features. At the same time, each script amalgamates influences from its own typographic

    Gulzar is a contemporary Urdu Nasta’liq typeface – and its Latin counterpart – designed and developed through a collaboration by Borna Izadpanah (Principal Designer and Project Leader), Simon Cozens (Font Engineering), Alice Savoie (Designer, Gulzar Latin), Fiona Ross (Consultant, Gulzar Urdu), Amir Mahdi Moslehi (Calligraphic adviser, Gulzar Urdu) and Martin Dodds (Consultant, Gulzar Urdu). This typeface was designed to provide an effective textual communication tool primarily for Urdu readers on digital platforms and in print. In Gulzar, the aim has been to produce a typeface which is legible at text sizes and suitable for sustained reading. The first phase of this project involved conducting research into the history of Urdu digital typefaces from the early 1980s. The design of Gulzar was inspired by carefully collected specimens of Urdu calligraphy and lettering which were closely studied to achieve an accurate representation of the Urdu flavour of the Nasta’liq style.


    Once the Nasta’liq design was firmly established, a proposal was made for a Latin counterpart that took inspiration from two eminent humanistic references: the versatile and sturdy proportions of Robert Granjon’s types, coupled with the sharp and distinctive feel of Hendrik van den Keere’s work. The Latin letterforms thus feature some subtle references to their calligraphic roots and echo the contrast present in the Nasta’liq, while remaining embedded in their classical typographic proportions.


    Gulzar is not the first OpenType Nasta’liq typeface, but it is the first Nasta’liq type for which an original Latin counterpart was designed. It covers all the required transliterations characters to transcribe Arabic, Persian and Urdu languages.


    You can read more about the inspiration, design, and engineering of Gulzar at gulzarfont.org.

While weights, widths and optical sizes were carefully crafted to work well in an Australian classroom environment, they are just as comfortable to read and work with in the home environment.
Each Australian state teaches different handwriting styles in lower primary school (although some states do share the same style). There are essentially three stages involved with each state's styles:
    
The foundational stage involves learning basic letter formation.
The transitional stage adds joining ligatures to some letters.
The cursive stage joins almost all letters (with some exceptions).



The NSW ACT School Fonts include both:
    
New South Wales Foundation Print - a simple sloped print for early primary school.
New South Wales Foundation Cursive - transitional joining letter alternates (pre-cursive stage).


Students in New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory learn Foundation Print from years 1 to 2 and Beginner Cursive from year 3.

When I start sketching I knew it would be a little less condensed than the original Empire because I wanted it to be used for use in titles, and combined with positive letter spacing it gives an elegant look to text. Although the original hasn't got a lowercase, I studied a lot of skyline typefaces and drew a fully original lowercase. I started with lowercase “o”, which isn't completely geometric, it is expanded to the outside, keeping the same whitespace through all weights. And this repeats all over the typeface, because the construction of all the characters was modular, based on that “o”; the “f” is designed to not meet any of the diacritics; and uppercase “A” has a traditional form, because I think this is more legible.","{'original', 'modern', 'personal', 'legible', 'little', 'traditional', 'complete'}",['Santiago Orozco']

    CBC/Radio-Canada is Canada's national public broadcaster. Their mandate is to inform, enlighten and entertain, in order to strengthen Canadian culture on radio, television and digital platforms.


    The Radio-Canada font was created in 2017 by Montreal-based designer and typographer Charles Daoud, in collaboration with Coppers and Brasses and Alexandre Saumier Demers. It was designed specifically for CBC/Radio-Canada as a brand unifying information
    font for all the Public Broadcaster’s platforms. Fittingly, for a Public Broadcaster, this is a peoples’ font and the humanistic style stands out with distinctive angles and subtle curves. Its x-height ensures excellent legibility and respects digital
    accessibility standards, making it very effective when used in continuous text.


    In 2018, the Radio-Canada font won three awards, in the Font Design category at Communication Arts Typography, Applied Arts Design Annual and at Grand Prix Grafika.


    Several optimizations saw the light of day in 2021. The number of supported languages has increased from 106 to 317 Latin languages. In 2022, Jacques Le Bailly (Baron von Fonthausen) expanded the font to include the support of Indigenous languages

    letter traditions, this family offers a versatile system that can meet the demands of a wide range of applications.

 Its expansive design space allows Anek to don multiple personalities. At its most condensed, capsular forms keep
    structures compact for that graphic texture. On the wide end of the spectrum, the extra legroom lets each letter
    yawn and stretch into their message. But it is in the boldest weights that Anek comes alive. Sharp terminals and
    tapered joineries sparkle amidst regimented forms, making this ideal for setting titillating headlines or that
    magnetic word-mark.
 Anek comes in ten scripts: Bangla, Devanagari, Kannada, Latin, Gujarati, Gurmukhi,
    Malayalam, Odia, Tamil and Telugu. The shared aesthetics of this type-family are drawn from a collaboratively
    decided pool of visual features. At the same time, each script amalgamates influences from its own typographic
    culture as well as the perspectives of individual designers.

Plaster is a very low contrast extremely geometric design done in the tradition of the work of Joseph Albers. However many of the solutions to the glyph design vary from Alber's choices. Plaster is suitable for use in medium to large sizes including headlines. This font deviates from most similar fonts because the space between letters is larger. The gaps in the stencil style letters makes letter identification more difficult. A wider letter space helps make the letters easy to read again.

Kumar is a series of matching Open Source display fonts. 
They each support the Gujarati and Latin scripts. 
The two Kumar fonts may be used together, or entirely on their own.


Kumar One Outline is a vertical-contrast design, in which both the downstrokes as well as the left and right-hand sides of each letterform are built up out of two parallel lines and the whites space in-between them. 
The upstrokes and typeface’s horizontals are just thin, single lines. 


Kumar One itself fills in all of the thicker empty spaces in the downstrokes/horizontals, offering letterforms that are very dark and full of contrast. 


The Kumar design is made entirely out of straight lines; all elements that would usually be drawn with soft curves are faceted, built up out of several shorter straightened-out elements. 
Text in either Kumar font shimmers like a jewel; the effect of both fonts is quite decorative. 


The Gujarati and Latin script components are scaled in relation to each other so that the Gujarati base characters are 85% as tall as the Latin uppercase. 
Text set in the Gujarati script sits nicely alongside the Latin lowercase, too. 
Kumar’s Gujarati vowel marks are all single-line, rather than double-line. 
Indeed, Kumar’s Gujarati is a very unique design; there are simply no other options like it currently available!


Each of the Kumar fonts has 870 glyphs, including hundreds of unique Gujarati conjuncts. 
The Latin component’s character set is an extended one, which enables typesetting in English and the other Western, Central, and Eastern European languages. 
Parimal Parmar designed Kumar for Indian Type Foundry in 2016.


The Kumar project is led by Indian Type Foundry, a type design foundry based in Ahmedabad, India.

Rhodium Libre was designed for use on screens at small sizes and the Latin and Devanagari scripts. 
To that end, the design is generally uncomplicated and coarse, lacking the small details that are lost on screens; this also reduces the file size to improve latency when used as a web font. 
The letters are designed slightly wide, with open counters, a large x-height in the Latin glyphs, and so on. 
The Devanagari glyphs are the same height as the Latin capitals to allow them to stand alongside the oversized Latin lowercase. 


Historical models for Rhodium’s design are Fortune (AKA Volta) by Konrad Bauer and Walter Baum, and Rex by Intertype. 
Matthew Carter’s Verdana provided insight into designing type for small sizes and adverse reading environments.


The Devanagari glyph set supports contemporary Hindi, Marathi, and Nepali.

From the early 1930s through World War II, there were about 200 professional hand letterers working in New York City alone. This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs. Alejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of today’s designer.

    the turn of the century. The result is a neutral yet friendly Grotesque style typeface that balances design with the
    engineered details that make Plex distinctly IBM. The
    family includes a Sans, Sans Condensed, Mono, and Serif and has excellent legibility in print, web, and mobile
    interfaces.


    Plex’s three designs work well independently and even better together. Use the Sans as a
    contemporary compadre, the Serif for editorial storytelling, or the Mono to show code snippets. The unexpectedly
    expressive nature of the italics gives you even more options for your designs. Currently, IBM Plex Sans supports
    Extended Latin, Arabic, Cyrillic, Devanagari, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean and Thai.

who had an old metal typeface wanted it to be digitalized for offset printing.
He brought everything the original type offered as a start, a set of upper
case characters, numbers, and some punctuation marks.
But what he brought in printed form was not enough to meet his needs, and
letterforms that did not exist had to be created. It is a fine job to
reinterpret a design, to make decisions on what already exists and also have
in mind the changes needed for the new technological context where Diplomata
will be used.
Its style, similar to Bodoni, has a remarkable degree of horizontal
expansion; a weight which indicates verticality; areas between serif and stem
softened by a curve connecting them, and the light in the main stroke of each
glyph is a detail that lightens up and gives prominence to Diplomata. It is a
distinct typeface, ideal for composing headlines and small prestigious pieces
of text.
The February 2023 update features a bigger glyphset, fractions and some minor aesthetic modifications.
To improve and expand the use of Diplomata, it was necessary to create
small caps and a lower case,
which ended up constituting this family that has two variables today.

    weights and widths by multiple designers. A well-informed, conscientious and refreshing interpretation of India’s
    letter traditions, this family offers a versatile system that can meet the demands of a wide range of applications.

 Its expansive design space allows Anek to don multiple personalities. At its most condensed, capsular forms keep
    structures compact for that graphic texture. On the wide end of the spectrum, the extra legroom lets each letter
    yawn and stretch into their message. But it is in the boldest weights that Anek comes alive. Sharp terminals and
    tapered joineries sparkle amidst regimented forms, making this ideal for setting titillating headlines or that
    magnetic word-mark.
 Anek comes in ten scripts: Bangla, Devanagari, Kannada, Latin, Gujarati, Gurmukhi,
    Malayalam, Odia, Tamil and Telugu. The shared aesthetics of this type-family are drawn from a collaboratively
    decided pool of visual features. At the same time, each script amalgamates influences from its own typographic
    culture as well as the perspectives of individual designers. 
 This project is designed, engineered and maintained by Ek Type; a collective of type designers based in Mumbai
    focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces. Contributors of this project are: Maithili Shingre (Anek

This occupation saw its demise with the advent of photo lettering, and after digital typography it became virtually extinct. The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs.

This font was developed by the Documenting Judeo-Spanish Project.


Documenting Judeo-Spanish is a digital humanities project that began in 2019 under the leadership of Dr. Bryan Kirschen. Recalling his initial fascination with Solitreo and the limited resources available to learn this script, Dr. Kirschen decided to focus this project on the cursive variety that was once common to speakers of Judeo-Spanish around the world. A nearly-extinct alphabet to an endangered language, this style of writing can be found in documents ranging from journal entries and ledgers to personal correspondence and community minutes. Many of these very documents are sitting in basements and attics today and, to the untrained eye, are mistaken for Hebrew.


Judeo-Spanish (Ladino) refers to the variety of Spanish that developed among Jewish populations who were expelled from Spain in 1492 and subsequently settled throughout Turkey and the Balkans, then of the Ottoman Empire. These Jews, known as Sephardim, preserved many features of Medieval (varieties of) Spanish, while incorporating linguistic elements from the languages spoken in their surroundings, including: Turkish, Greek, Serbo-Croatian, French, Italian, and Arabic. As a Jewish language, the Spanish of the Sephardim has always been in contact with Hebrew. And while Judeo-Spanish may sound like other Romance languages, in writing, it would have traditionally appeared more similar to a Semitic language.


Solitreo refers to the Hebrew-based cursive script once used by Sephardim; it is the cursive variety of the Rashi alphabet. Solitreo, or Soletreo, is derived from Galician/Portuguese, meaning ‘to spell.’ For many Sephardim, Solitreo was simply known as ganchos, meaning ‘hooks,’ due to the ligatures that form between letters. This style of writing is distinct from the Ashkenazi-based alphabet used for cursive Hebrew today, making documents in Solitreo undecipherable to the untrained eye. A similar style of writing can also be found in documents written in Judeo-Arabic. Today, Solitreo is a relic of the past, as most writers of the language utilize Roman characters.


Most non-Hebrew glyphs in this font were forked from Kalam.

The odd way in which the Bluemlein scripts were assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is a fascinating calligraphic adventure.

Furthermore, by the end of the 19th century bibliology had become an established section of Historical Studies, and, as John Bowman commented, the prevailing attitude was that Greek types should adhere to a lost idealized, yet undefined, greekness of yore. Especially in Great Britain this tendency remained unchallenged in the first decades of the 20th century, both by Richard Proctor, curator of the incunabula section in the British Museum Library and his successor Victor Scholderer. In 1927, Scholderer, on behalf of the Society for the Promotion of Greek Studies, got involved in choosing and consulting the design and production of a Greek type called New Hellenic cut by the Lanston Monotype Corporation. He chose the revival of a round, and almost monoline type which had first appeared in 1492 in the edition of Macrobius, ascribable to the printing shop of Giovanni Rosso (Joannes Rubeus) in Venice. New Hellenic was the only successful typeface in Great Britain after the introduction of Porson Greek well over a century before. The type, since to 1930’s, was also well received in Greece, albeit with a different design for Ξ and Ω. GFS digitized the typeface (1993-1994) funded by the Athens Archeological Society with the addition of a new set of epigraphical symbols. Later (2000) more weights were added (italic, bold and bold italic) as well as a latin version.","{'different', 'special', 'graphic'}",['Greek Font Society']

    the turn of the century. The result is a neutral yet friendly Grotesque style typeface that balances design with the
    engineered details that make Plex distinctly IBM. The
    family includes a Sans, Sans Condensed, Mono, and Serif and has excellent legibility in print, web, and mobile
    interfaces.


    Plex’s three designs work well independently and even better together. Use the Sans as a
    contemporary compadre, the Serif for editorial storytelling, or the Mono to show code snippets. The unexpectedly
    expressive nature of the italics gives you even more options for your designs. Currently, IBM Plex Sans supports
    Extended Latin, Arabic, Cyrillic, Devanagari, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean and Thai.

    weights and widths by multiple designers. A well-informed, conscientious and refreshing interpretation of India’s
    letter traditions, this family offers a versatile system that can meet the demands of a wide range of applications.

 Its expansive design space allows Anek to don multiple personalities. At its most condensed, capsular forms keep
    structures compact for that graphic texture. On the wide end of the spectrum, the extra legroom lets each letter
    yawn and stretch into their message. But it is in the boldest weights that Anek comes alive. Sharp terminals and
    tapered joineries sparkle amidst regimented forms, making this ideal for setting titillating headlines or that
    magnetic word-mark.
 Anek comes in ten scripts: Bangla, Devanagari, Kannada, Latin, Gujarati, Gurmukhi,
    Malayalam, Odia, Tamil and Telugu. The shared aesthetics of this type-family are drawn from a collaboratively
    decided pool of visual features. At the same time, each script amalgamates influences from its own typographic
    culture as well as the perspectives of individual designers.

    focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces. Contributors of this project are: Maithili Shingre (Anek

    weights and widths by multiple designers. A well-informed, conscientious and refreshing interpretation of India’s
    letter traditions, this family offers a versatile system that can meet the demands of a wide range of applications.

 Its expansive design space allows Anek to don multiple personalities. At its most condensed, capsular forms keep
    structures compact for that graphic texture. On the wide end of the spectrum, the extra legroom lets each letter
    yawn and stretch into their message. But it is in the boldest weights that Anek comes alive. Sharp terminals and
    tapered joineries sparkle amidst regimented forms, making this ideal for setting titillating headlines or that
    magnetic word-mark.
 Anek comes in ten scripts: Bangla, Devanagari, Kannada, Latin, Gujarati, Gurmukhi,
    Malayalam, Odia, Tamil and Telugu. The shared aesthetics of this type-family are drawn from a collaboratively
    decided pool of visual features. At the same time, each script amalgamates influences from its own typographic

    Tiro Devanagari Marathi has its origins in a typeface designed for the Murty Classical Library of India book series, so is especially suited to traditional literary publishing but also made with the needs of today’s multiple print and screen media in
    mind. The Tiro Devanagari design applies a contemporary approach to the traditional styling of 19th and 20th Century metal types exemplified in those of the renowned Nirnaya Sagar Press, and is characterised by broader proportions, more generous counters,
    and strong diagonal strokes and terminals. The Marathi font favours traditional, vertical forms of many conjuncts as still found in Marathi literary publishing. For the Open Font License release, Tiro Devanagari Marathi has been extended to support
    additional characters, and features a new italic companion. Each font also includes a Latin subset including diacritics for transcription of Indian languages.


    Tiro Devanagari Marathi was designed by John Hudson and Fiona Ross. The italic was adapted by Paul Hanslow.

    letter traditions, this family offers a versatile system that can meet the demands of a wide range of applications.

 Its expansive design space allows Anek to don multiple personalities. At its most condensed, capsular forms keep
    structures compact for that graphic texture. On the wide end of the spectrum, the extra legroom lets each letter
    yawn and stretch into their message. But it is in the boldest weights that Anek comes alive. Sharp terminals and
    tapered joineries sparkle amidst regimented forms, making this ideal for setting titillating headlines or that
    magnetic word-mark.
 Anek comes in ten scripts: Bangla, Devanagari, Kannada, Latin, Gujarati, Gurmukhi,
    Malayalam, Odia, Tamil and Telugu. The shared aesthetics of this type-family are drawn from a collaboratively
    decided pool of visual features. At the same time, each script amalgamates influences from its own typographic

The foundational stage involves learning basic letter formation.
The transitional stage adds joining ligatures to some letters.
The cursive stage joins almost all letters (with some exceptions).

While weights, widths and optical sizes were carefully crafted to work well in an Australian classroom environment, they are just as comfortable to read and work with in the home environment.
Each Australian state teaches different handwriting styles in lower primary school (although some states do share the same style). There are essentially three stages involved with each state's styles:
    
The foundational stage involves learning basic letter formation.
The transitional stage adds joining ligatures to some letters.
The cursive stage joins almost all letters (with some exceptions).



The QLD School Fonts include both:
    
Queensland Beginners Alphabet - a simple sloped print for early primary school.
Queensland Beginners Cursive - transitional joining letter alternates (pre-cursive stage).

    
Students in Queensland learn QBeginners from years 1 to 3 and QCursive from year 4.
 
Google Workspace users are provided standard versions online, however they may download or build the complete OpenType versions from GitHub for local installations. To download the full version, or to contribute, see github.com/MezMerrit/AU-School-Handwriting-Fonts.

    Tiro Tamil has its origins in a typeface designed for the Murty Classical Library of India book series, so is especially suited to traditional literary publishing but also made with the needs of today’s multiple print and screen media in mind. The design
    takes inspiration from Tamil metal types developed in Madras (Chennai) in the 19th and early 20th Century, which were influenced by both traditional palm leaf manuscripts and contemporary writing. The stroke modulation makes for a dynamic design for
    modern typography, while traditional forms of ligatures are accessible via OpenType Layout features. For the Open Font License release, Tiro Tamil has been extended to support additional characters, and features a new italic companion suitable for
    traditional slanted Tamil typography. Each font also includes a Latin subset including diacritics for transcription of Indian languages.


    Tiro Tamil was designed by Fernando Mello and Fiona Ross. The italic was adapted by Kaja Słojewska.

Blaka is an experimental typeface, enriching the gothic feeling of Black Letters by enhancing the
    geometric features to create midgrounds with the Kufic style for the Arabic letterforms.


    The aesthetical matching process between the two scripts relies on the features of being hand-drawn with a reed
    pen. While Latin letterforms maintain sharp edges, Arabic relies on sharp edges and thick strokes to create overlaps
    to replace a usual baseline in most letterforms, giving the Arabic letterforms contemporary features.


    The font family comes in two styles, Blaka and Blaka Hollow, featuring an outlined version of the font. Blaka also
    comes in two variants, the usual monochrome variants as well as an Ink variant Blaka Ink. The Ink variant
    are color fonts where the colors are defined by the font itself. Support for color fonts is currently limited to few
    applications like Google Chrome (version 98 or later).
