# font-recommender-system


This font recommender system was created and tested as a part of HU University of Applied Science Utrecht Master's called Data-Driven Design for a course "State of the  Art Technology".

For the recommender prototypes to work, a folder called "collectedttf" is needed. The folder contains .ttf files of all fonts (names of fonts can be found in avaliablefonts.csv)and allows the font display. The folder even when compressed is still too big (973 MB) to upload on GitHub. If you would like to test the prototype yourself feel free to send me an email regarding the .ttf files.
